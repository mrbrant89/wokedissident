## If It Looks Like a Duck…

We’ve been here before. A strongman rises, demonizes minorities, attacks the press, and promises to restore national glory while demanding absolute loyalty. It’s the same old authoritarian playbook, yet people still hesitate to call it what it is: **fascism.**

Trump isn’t just another bad president. He’s not just “controversial.” He’s not just “right-wing.” **He’s a fascist.**

### The Nazi Salutes: It’s Not Subtle

At CPAC 2025, Steve Bannon, Trump’s former strategist, stood before the crowd and raised his arm in what looked suspiciously like a Nazi salute. It wasn’t a coincidence. It wasn’t an accident. And it wasn’t the first time.

Elon Musk, Trump’s most prominent billionaire ally, did the exact same gesture at Trump’s **inauguration parade**. He was standing alongside far-right figures, and when called out, his response was classic gaslighting: "Just an awkward moment!" Meanwhile, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) rushed in with damage control, saying, "It’s just a wave."

Except, of course, it wasn’t. **Neo-Nazi groups celebrated the salute.** They knew exactly what it was. ([AP News](https://apnews.com/article/musk-gesture-salute-antisemitism-0070dae53c7a73397b104ae645877535))

When far-right extremists openly embrace a gesture and defend it as their own, you don’t get to brush it off as an accident.

## Hannah Arendt Warned Us About This

Hannah Arendt, in *The Origins of Totalitarianism*, described how totalitarian regimes manipulate reality to make people doubt their own eyes. She warned about the slow erosion of truth, where a society is groomed to accept obvious lies as fact.

Sound familiar?

We see it in Trump’s world daily:
- The 2020 election was "stolen," despite overwhelming evidence it wasn’t.
- Climate change is a "hoax."
- The media is "the enemy of the people."

The goal isn’t to convince you of one singular truth. The goal is to exhaust you. To make reality so distorted that people just give up and accept whatever the strongman says.

This is **textbook fascism**—break people’s ability to think critically, then control them through manufactured reality.

## Orwell’s *1984*: Deny What’s in Front of Your Eyes

In *1984*, Orwell wrote:

> *“The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command.”*

We are living this now.

- You see Trump praising dictators. His supporters tell you he’s a champion of democracy.
- You see Nazi salutes at rallies. They tell you it’s just "enthusiastic waving."
- You see protesters brutalized in the streets. They tell you it’s "law and order."

Every authoritarian regime demands that you ignore what’s right in front of you. Trumpism does the same.

## Deportations and Thought Crimes

Trump’s immigration policies weren’t just about controlling borders. They were about **punishing** people for existing. Even legal immigrants. Even scientists. Even doctors.

### Case 1: Denied Entry for Criticizing Trump

A Harvard-affiliated Palestinian researcher, Ismail Ajjawi, was **denied entry** to the U.S. and deported after Customs and Border Protection officers searched his phone and found posts critical of Trump. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/03/harvard-student-immigration-palestinian))

He didn’t even write the posts—his *friends* did. Thought crime.

### Case 2: Scientists and Doctors Barred for Wrong Politics

Green card holders and H-1B visa holders—**scientists, doctors, and engineers**—were detained, harassed, and deported for trivial reasons. In one case, a scientist was denied entry because he had posted **concerns about Trump cutting science research funding.**

### Case 3: Green Card Holders Treated Like Criminals

Permanent residents—people *legally living* in the U.S. for decades—were suddenly detained and threatened with deportation over minor infractions. Some were stripped of their status over **traffic violations** or bureaucratic errors.

- [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/03/us/immigration-naturalization-denials.html) reported on green card holders being detained for decades-old paperwork issues.
- [The Intercept](https://theintercept.com/2020/10/12/ice-green-card-deportations/) exposed ICE officials targeting **legal immigrants** for deportation simply because they could.

When the government starts arbitrarily stripping people of legal status, **it’s not about law enforcement. It’s about control.**

## Trump’s Own Officials Called Him Fascist

It’s not just critics saying this. **His own people** said it.

John Kelly, Trump’s former Chief of Staff, admitted Trump wanted to use the **military against political opponents.** He specifically talked about Trump admiring dictators, even **praising Hitler.** ([PBS](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-said-hitler-did-some-good-things-and-wanted-generals-like-the-nazis-former-chief-of-staff-kelly-claims))

This isn’t rhetoric. This is **literal fascism.**

## The Endgame: Trump Promised Retribution

Trump is openly promising to use the government to punish enemies.

- He calls the press "the enemy of the people."
- He vows to "lock up" political opponents.
- He tells his followers **he is their retribution.**

Fascism isn’t about policies. It’s about **power and revenge.**

## Call It What It Is

People hesitate to use the word "fascist" because they think it sounds extreme. But the reality is, **if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it’s a duck.**

Trump is a fascist.

The Nazi salutes aren’t a coincidence.
The press crackdowns aren’t a coincidence.
The purges of legal immigrants aren’t a coincidence.
The embrace of dictators isn’t a coincidence.

It’s time to stop pretending. Call it what it is.
