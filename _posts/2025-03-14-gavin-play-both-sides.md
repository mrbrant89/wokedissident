## Giving Newsom the Benefit of the Doubt—Until Now

When Gavin Newsom said transgender women competing in women’s sports was "deeply unfair," I defended him. It was a politically risky move, but at least it was factually correct. 

But now? Now it’s clear that **this wasn’t about fairness.** It was about pandering to MAGA voters. And that never works. 

MAGA voters will **never** support Newsom, no matter how much he signals to them. Instead, he’s alienating the people who actually backed him. He’s torched his credibility, and possibly his future.

## A Timeline of Newsom’s Shift Toward MAGA Messaging

### February 26, 2025 – Announces Podcast Featuring MAGA Guests

Newsom launched his new podcast, *This is Gavin Newsom*, featuring conservative guests—including MAGA figures. His reasoning? “We already know our disagreements. I want to understand their motivations.”

Translation: “I’m testing a move to the center.”

**Reaction:**
- Democrats saw it as an attempt to rebrand for a 2028 run.
- LGBTQ+ groups warned against legitimizing far-right voices.
- Republicans mocked the effort—because they don’t respect him.

### March 6, 2025 – Newsom Agrees With Charlie Kirk on Trans Athletes

For the podcast debut, Newsom sat down with MAGA propagandist **Charlie Kirk** and **fully agreed** with him on transgender women in sports:

> **“I completely agree with you… It’s deeply unfair.”** – Newsom

Then came **more red flags:**
- **Praising a Trump ad attacking Kamala Harris** on gender-affirming care in prisons. *“Brutal. A great ad.”*
- **Dismissing progressive language** like pronouns and "Latinx"—a GOP talking point.
- **Calling defunding the police “lunacy”** and criticizing Black Lives Matter leadership.
- **Letting Kirk call gender-affirming care “butchery” without pushback.**

**Reaction:**
- **LGBTQ+ groups blasted Newsom** for validating anti-trans rhetoric.
- **Even his allies were furious.** CA State Sen. Scott Wiener called it "profoundly disturbing."
- **Charlie Kirk gloated** that Newsom’s statement proved conservatives were “winning.”

### March 10, 2025 – Newsom Hosts Michael Savage, Blames Trans Issues for Dem Losses

Newsom’s second guest? **Michael Savage**, a far-right radio host. Savage ranted about **trans issues “brainwashing kids”** and blamed LGBTQ+ rights for Democratic losses in 2024.

Newsom’s response? Not to push back—but to **validate the framing.**

> **“Interesting… You felt our party was complicit in creating those conditions.”** – Newsom

**Reaction:**
- **GLAAD condemned Newsom** for hosting anti-trans guests back-to-back *without* including a trans voice.
- **Democrats saw a pattern forming**—Newsom was blaming “wokeness” for election losses.

### March 13, 2025 – Newsom Hosts Steve Bannon

In episode three, Newsom **platformed Steve Bannon.**

- **Surprise common ground:** Both Bannon and Newsom criticized Elon Musk’s influence.
- **Newsom joked about “getting along” with Trump.**
- **He treated Bannon like a legitimate voice** rather than a far-right propagandist.

This was the breaking point.

**Reaction:**
- **Adam Kinzinger (anti-Trump Republican) blasted Newsom:** *“I’m in shock at the stupidity of inviting Steve Bannon.”*
- **Democrats asked: Why is Newsom legitimizing extremists?**

### March 10, 2025 – Newsom’s Hardline Immigration Post

On the same day, Newsom **posted a tough-on-immigration message**:

> **“The asylum system is broken. The federal government needs to stop ignoring their failure.”**

Sound familiar? It’s straight from the GOP playbook.

**Reaction:**
- **Border-state Republicans cheered.**
- **Immigrant-rights groups were horrified.**

## Newsom’s Big Mistake: MAGA Won’t Save Him

MAGA voters aren’t **moderates** waiting to be convinced. They’re extremists who **will never vote for a Democrat—no matter what.**

- They don’t care if you agree with them on one issue. They’ll always call you a “groomer” anyway.
- They don’t want to debate. They want you to submit.
- You can’t win them over. They will still vote for Trump.

Meanwhile, Newsom is **actively alienating his own base.**

- Progressives won’t trust him now.
- LGBTQ+ groups feel betrayed.
- His “moderate pivot” will be used against him in any Democratic primary.

## Final Thought: Newsom Just Threw Away His Future

Newsom wants to be president. He’s testing out a pivot to the center. But here’s the hard truth:

- **Democrats who pander to MAGA always fail.**
- **He’s not winning over conservatives.**
- **He’s losing the people who actually supported him.**

This isn’t strategy. It’s self-sabotage.

**Gavin, you just ruined your career. Hope it was worth it.**

Newsom wanted to play both sides. Instead, **he played himself.**
