Donald Trump paid off a porn star to stay quiet about their affair.

He lied about it.

He falsified business records.

He's facing **34 felony charges** over it.

He also bragged about grabbing women by the pussy, was accused of **rape** by multiple women, and has more sexual assault allegations than most prison inmates doing life.

But sure, tell us more about drag queen story hour.

## Daddy Issues: Elon Musk Edition

The other moral saint of the GOP, Elon Musk, now has **14 known children** with **six different women** ([Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/story/all-elon-musk-children-and-mothers), [NBC](https://www.today.com/parents/parents/elon-musk-kids-rcna19692)).

Yes, **14.**

- Secret babies with Neuralink executive Shivon Zilis
- A child with MAGA influencer Ashley St. Clair (she had to sue for paternity)
- A daughter who legally disowned him and said, “I don’t want to be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form.”

He’s got a kid named **Techno Mechanicus** and tweets like he named himself after a Halo DLC.

But he's now the conservative poster boy because he said the word “woke” in a grumpy voice.

## Morality Laws from the Morally Bankrupt

Let’s be real: Republicans don’t want morality. They want **control.**

- They want to ban books with gay characters.
- They want to criminalize drag performances.
- They want to legislate what you can say, read, wear, watch, and fuck.

All while cheering on two dudes who treat women like disposable assets and children like Pokémon.

> When Trump was banging porn stars and Musk was multiplying like a fertility clinic, drag queens were reading kids *actual books.*

## "Think of the Children!"

The same people who lose their minds over a queer librarian reading "And Tango Makes Three" are:

- Silent when Elon Musk dodges child support drama.
- Unbothered by Trump being found **liable for sexual abuse** in civil court.
- Fine with their kids wearing AR-15 lapel pins, but melt down over rainbow flags.

They scream about “groomers” while ignoring the *actual grooming* happening inside churches, private Christian schools, and political donor circles.

> Statistically, your kid is safer at a drag show than at Bible camp.

## Meet the Other Morality Mascots: Gaetz & Jordan

Let’s add some more characters to this morality play:

**Matt Gaetz**: Under federal investigation for allegedly paying for sex with a minor and trafficking her across state lines. And while the DOJ declined to press charges, the evidence was enough to make most people change their Instagram passwords.

**Jim Jordan**: Accused by multiple former athletes at Ohio State of ignoring sexual abuse while he was a coach. His defense? “I didn’t hear about it.” Somehow, the guy who can smell a Marxist in a school board meeting couldn’t hear kids begging for help down the hallway.

And yet both are stars in the Republican Party.

## The Epstein Elephant in the Room

You can’t talk about GOP moral hypocrisy without mentioning **Jeffrey Epstein**.

Trump partied with him. Prince Andrew got exposed. Bill Barr's DOJ slow-walked investigations. Epstein mysteriously died in custody. And somehow, **no one in power** has been held accountable.

Meanwhile, Republicans were more upset about Mr. Potato Head’s pronouns than Epstein’s child sex trafficking empire.

## Bonus Round: The Evangelical Enablers

Let’s talk about the church crowd.

These are the folks who call Trump “God’s chosen instrument.”

The ones who pray for Musk’s wisdom while ignoring his family tree that looks like a Reddit thread.

They rant about “biblical marriage” while defending a guy who:

- Cheated on all three wives
- Paid $130k in hush money
- Was caught on tape boasting about assault

And they still line up to vote for him with “Jesus Is My Savior, Trump Is My President” bumper stickers.

## This Isn’t About Morality. It’s About Power.

If it was about protecting kids, they'd go after:

- Catholic priests who molested thousands
- GOP donors caught with child porn
- Evangelical leaders abusing power and children
- Epstein’s client list

Instead? They go after **teachers with pronouns in their bio.**

Because targeting the marginalized is easier than holding your idols accountable.

## Final Thought: Pants Down, Bible Up

Until Republicans clean up their own house full of serial cheaters, abusers, and perverts,

> They don’t get to talk about morality.

Let Trump confess to a few more mistresses. Let Musk knock up a few more executives. Let Gaetz text fewer teens. Just don’t lecture the rest of us about what’s “appropriate” for children while you're cheering on men who treat fatherhood like a meme and justice like a joke.

Because nothing says family values like a porn star payoff.
