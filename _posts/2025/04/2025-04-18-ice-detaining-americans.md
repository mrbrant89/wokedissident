</figure>

Welcome to Trump's second term—where federal law enforcement doesn’t just bend the Constitution, it breaks it with a smile.

ICE is now detaining U.S. citizens. DEA agents are seizing life savings at airports without charges. And the people in charge don’t care if you’re a citizen, a legal resident, or just someone with brown skin and a backpack.

The civil liberties you've taken for granted? Gone. Quietly erased under a mountain of executive orders, DHS memos, and “interdiction programs” so shady they’d make Nixon blush.

This post isn’t about immigrants. It’s about the future of your freedom.

You ready?

## Policy Overhaul = Constitution on Fire

### What Changed After Jan 20, 2025?

Trump didn’t waste time.

**Day one:** DHS torched the Biden-era restrictions that kept ICE out of hospitals, schools, churches, and protests. Nowhere is off-limits. The new directive? Hunt everywhere. Hide nowhere.

> “Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America’s schools and churches to avoid arrest.”  
>
> — DHS spokesperson, Jan 21, 2025 [4](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/01/21/statement-dhs-spokesperson-directives-expanding-law-enforcement-and-ending-abuse)

And that wasn’t even the most dangerous part.

**Humanitarian parole?** Gutted.  
**Refugee resettlement?** Frozen.  
**Asylum?** Dead.  
**ICE raids?** Greenlit for anywhere, anytime, anyone [1](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1517287/epub).

All of it done with the stroke of a pen—executive orders designed to bypass Congress and fast-track authoritarianism.

### Broadening the Boots on the Ground

Then it got worse.  

DHS didn’t just expand ICE. It **deputized other federal agencies**—like the DEA, ATF, and U.S. Marshals—to act as immigration enforcers.

> “To bolster our capacity for mass deportations, DOJ agencies are now authorized to locate and apprehend undocumented migrants.” 
>  
> — DHS Memo, Jan 23, 2025 [5](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dhs-authorizes-federal-law-enforcement-to-implement-trump-immigration-policies/)

Let that sink in: Drug cops. Gun cops. Now rounding up immigrants. These agencies weren’t trained for this. They weren’t meant for this. And they sure as hell aren’t known for respecting civil rights.

### The Return of 287(g): Racial Profiling on Autopilot

The infrastructure for federal overreach already existed. Trump just **flipped the switch again**.

The **287(g) program** deputizes local cops—often racist, untrained sheriffs—to act as ICE agents. The ACLU calls it what it is: a profiling pipeline.

- 59% of sheriffs in 287(g) programs have **documented anti-immigrant rhetoric** [7](https://www.aclu.org/publications/license-abuse-how-ices-287g-program-empowers-racist-sheriffs).
- Nearly two-thirds have histories of **civil rights violations** [6](https://www.aclu.org/news/topic/stop-ice-from-empowering-racist-sheriffs-end-287g-agreements).
- Many make arrests for **petty offenses**—then funnel arrestees into deportation [8](https://www.aclu.org/news/immigrants-rights/ice-program-foments-abuse-hatred-and-fear-and-makes-us-all-less-safe).

They aren't capturing *dangerous criminals*, they're **turning traffic stops into deportation raids**. And in 2025, the dragnet just got bigger.

## ICE Is Snatching Citizens. Again.

Let’s kill the myth right now:

**ICE doesn’t just target undocumented immigrants.** They’ve been detaining **U.S. citizens** for years. And under Trump’s second term, it’s happening again—with more aggression and less accountability.

### Real People, Real Passports, Still Detained

#### Mahmoud Khalil

- Legal permanent resident. Columbia University grad student.
- Outspoken supporter of Palestinian rights.
- Detained by ICE in early 2025.
- Government tried to transfer his case out of state—**away from his legal counsel**—to shut him up.

His lawyers called it what it was: retaliation for political speech. The court agreed.

> “The lawsuit should proceed in New Jersey, not be buried in Louisiana.”  
> 
> — ACLU press release, April 2025 [14](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/court-rules-mahmoud-khalils-lawsuit-challenging-his-unlawful-detention-by-ice-should-move-forward-in-new-jersey)

This isn’t just a First Amendment case. It’s a **test of whether ICE can use immigration law to silence dissent**.

#### Ernesto Campos
- Born in the U.S.
- Owns a business.
- Detained by Border Patrol in Kern County, California… **because he had an undocumented employee in his truck**.

They slashed his tires. Accused him of “alien smuggling.” No charges. Just hours of detention and harassment.

And he’s not alone.

> “A Trump voter pulled over and cuffed by ICE. A Native American questioned far from the border. A citizen arrested during a raid.”  
> 
> — [NM Political Report](https://nmpoliticalreport.com/2025/03/18/some-americans-have-already-been-caught-in-trumps-immigration-dragnet-more-will-be/) <a href="https://nmpoliticalreport.com/2025/03/18/some-americans-have-already-been-caught-in-trumps-immigration-dragnet-more-will-be/">[13]</a>

Mistaken identity? Doesn’t matter. Legal papers? Ignored. 

You look foreign? That’s all it takes.

### Built to Fail: ICE’s Systemic Screw-Ups

It’s not just rogue agents. It’s baked into the system.

- **ICE doesn’t even track how many citizens it detains.** GAO confirmed it. ICE refused to give numbers to ProPublica <a href="https://nmpoliticalreport.com/2025/03/18/some-americans-have-already-been-caught-in-trumps-immigration-dragnet-more-will-be/">[13]</a>.
- **Officers aren’t trained on citizenship verification protocols.** Even though they’re supposed to be <a href="https://nmpoliticalreport.com/2025/03/18/some-americans-have-already-been-caught-in-trumps-immigration-dragnet-more-will-be/">[13]</a>.
- **No central database** exists for checking citizenship in real time <a href="https://nmpoliticalreport.com/2025/03/18/some-americans-have-already-been-caught-in-trumps-immigration-dragnet-more-will-be/">[13]</a>.

The result? People with U.S. birth certificates, Social Security numbers, and valid passports still get detained. And there’s **no way to audit how often** it happens.

ICE can violate your rights—and no one will even count it.

## DEA at the Gate – Civil Forfeiture Hustle

Flying while brown? Carrying cash? The DEA thinks that’s “suspicious.” And under civil forfeiture, suspicion is all they need to take everything you have.

This isn’t hypothetical. It’s happened thousands of times—and until **January 2025**, it was official DEA policy.

### Caught in the Act

  <figcaption>DEA agent caught threatening a passenger at a Kentucky airport. No warrant. No crime. Just intimidation. <a href="https://ij.org/press-release/new-institute-for-justice-video-exposes-unconstitutional-airport-interdiction-tactics/">[20]</a></figcaption>
</figure>

The traveler, David C., did everything right:
- He asked if he was being detained.
- He refused to consent to a bag search.
- He recorded the encounter.

Didn’t matter. The DEA still tried to **take his bag and walk off the plane**. And he wasn’t carrying anything illegal—just personal items and a laptop.

This wasn’t a rogue agent. It was part of a broader pattern of unconstitutional stops targeting travelers with **cash**.

### Legal Theft, Codified

The tool they used? **Civil asset forfeiture.** Translation:  
> *We think your money might be suspicious, so we’re taking it. If you want it back, hire a lawyer and prove you’re innocent.*

No arrest. No charges. Just legalized robbery.

**Documented cases:**
- **Terrence Rolin**: $82,373 seized in Pittsburgh. Returned only after a court battle [23](https://ij.org/case/dea-tsa-forfeitures/).  
- **Stacy Jones**: $43,167 seized in North Carolina. Claimed it was from a car sale [24](https://www.criminallegalnews.org/news/2021/apr/15/abuse-civil-asset-forfeiture-laws-prompts-class-action-lawsuit/).  
- **Kermit Warren**: $28,000 seized while flying to buy a tow truck. Never charged [24](https://www.criminallegalnews.org/news/2021/apr/15/abuse-civil-asset-forfeiture-laws-prompts-class-action-lawsuit/).

Over **$209 million** seized at airports over a decade, with **no criminal charges in most cases** [19](https://reason.com/2025/01/16/dea-ends-airport-gate-searches-after-years-of-documented-abuses-of-civil-asset-forfeiture/).

### IJ Fights Back

The **Institute for Justice** sued the DEA and TSA in a class action:
- Arguing TSA had no legal authority to detain travelers after screening.
- Arguing DEA seized cash based on *nothing but vibes*.
- Demanding systemic reform [23](https://ij.org/case/dea-tsa-forfeitures/).

The case gained momentum after viral videos like David C.’s went public [20](https://ij.org/press-release/new-institute-for-justice-video-exposes-unconstitutional-airport-interdiction-tactics/). Then, finally:

> “DEA ends Transportation Interdiction Program after internal review deems it ineffective.”  
> 
> — Reason Magazine, Jan 16, 2025 <a href="https://reason.com/2025/01/16/dea-ends-airport-gate-searches-after-years-of-documented-abuses-of-civil-asset-forfeiture/">[19]</a>

But don’t pop the champagne yet.

The DEA didn’t end the program because it violated rights. They ended it because it didn’t produce enough arrests <a href="https://reason.com/2025/01/16/dea-ends-airport-gate-searches-after-years-of-documented-abuses-of-civil-asset-forfeiture/">[19]</a>. Meaning: **the cash seizures will just happen elsewhere**.

## Brown = Suspicious

Being a U.S. citizen doesn’t matter if you don’t *look* like one.

### Profiled for Existing

In January 2025, ICE and Border Patrol rolled into **Kern County, California** and raided local farms. Among the detained:

- A **U.S. citizen**: Ernesto Campos, accused of smuggling “illegals” because he had an undocumented worker in his truck.
- A **56-year-old lawful permanent resident**: Handcuffed without cause.
- Dozens of **Latino farmworkers**: Interrogated and detained on the spot.

No warrants. No probable cause. Just brown skin and proximity to a field.

> “It was a fishing expedition. They were profiling.”  
> 
> — ACLU of Southern California <a href="https://nmpoliticalreport.com/2025/03/18/some-americans-have-already-been-caught-in-trumps-immigration-dragnet-more-will-be/">[13]</a>

And it’s not just Latinos.

### Political Dissent = Deportation Risk

Mahmoud Khalil wasn’t just detained because he’s Arab. He was detained because he **spoke up**—for Palestinian rights.

The Trump administration’s legal strategy? Use an obscure Cold War-era rule—the “foreign policy bar”—to justify detention or visa revocation based on political speech.

That’s right: express the wrong opinion, and ICE may knock on your door [14](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/court-rules-mahmoud-khalils-lawsuit-challenging-his-unlawful-detention-by-ice-should-move-forward-in-new-jersey).

This should terrify everyone with a protest sign, a nonwhite name, or an opinion on foreign policy.

### Surveillance Just Makes It Easier

New tech, same bias.

- **Facial recognition** used by DHS has been proven to misidentify Black and Brown faces at alarming rates [30](https://www.usccr.gov/files/2024-09/civil-rights-implications-of-frt_0.pdf).
- **License plate scanners** disproportionately track drivers in poor and minority neighborhoods [29](https://researchrepository.wvu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&context=law_faculty).

When ICE and DEA plug into this tech?  

Guess who gets stopped first. Guess who gets detained.

And since January 2025, those tools are being used **with fewer restrictions** than ever.

## Fighting Back (In Court)

When the government starts acting like it’s above the law, there’s only one tool left: **litigation**. Slow, expensive, frustrating—and absolutely vital.

These lawsuits aren’t just about getting people out of detention. They’re about **dragging ICE and DEA practices into the light**. And sometimes? They win.

### Key Lawsuits (Post-Jan 2025)

| **Case**                         | **Agency**     | **Allegation**                                                  | **Status**                |
|----------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Khalil v. Trump**              | ICE            | Detained LPR for political speech (1st/5th Amendments)           | Venue victory, ongoing [14](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/court-rules-mahmoud-khalils-lawsuit-challenging-his-unlawful-detention-by-ice-should-move-forward-in-new-jersey) |
| **IJ Class Action v. DEA/TSA**   | DEA, TSA       | Airport searches, cash seizures without probable cause           | Ongoing, helped kill TIP [23](https://ij.org/case/dea-tsa-forfeitures/) |
| **ACLU FOIA (Solitary Confinement)** | ICE        | Forced ICE to release secret detention policy from Dec 2024      | Docs released April 2025 [17](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-details-on-ices-solitary-confinement-policy-directive) |
| **ACLU FOIA (ICE Air Operations)**  | ICE         | Targeting secret deportation flight infrastructure               | Ongoing [31](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-sues-ice-for-records-on-deportation-flight-infrastructure) |

### Transparency Lawsuits Are Crucial

Agencies like ICE and DEA don’t volunteer information. They bury it. So the **ACLU uses FOIA** (Freedom of Information Act) litigation to force disclosure:

- The **solitary confinement directive** ICE didn’t want you to see? Now public [17](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-details-on-ices-solitary-confinement-policy-directive).  
- The **secret playbook for mass deportation flights**? ACLU is suing to get it [31](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-sues-ice-for-records-on-deportation-flight-infrastructure).

These cases matter because without them, we wouldn’t know half of what’s in this post.

### One Lawsuit Ended a Federal Program

Let’s be clear: the DEA didn’t end its airport search program (TIP) because it had a moral awakening. It ended it because **the Institute for Justice sued, the media piled on, and the DOJ finally blinked** [19](https://reason.com/2025/01/16/dea-ends-airport-gate-searches-after-years-of-documented-abuses-of-civil-asset-forfeiture/).

> “Significant issues… with documentation, training, and constitutional risks.”  
> 
> — DOJ Inspector General report, Nov 2024 [22](https://reason.com/2024/11/21/justice-department-orders-dea-to-halt-airport-searches-because-of-significant-issues-with-cash-seizures/)

It took:
- Years of abuse,
- Public outrage,
- Viral video evidence [20](https://ij.org/press-release/new-institute-for-justice-video-exposes-unconstitutional-airport-interdiction-tactics/),
- And a massive class action suit—

To end one program.

Now imagine how many others are still running.

## FAQ: What You Need to Know (Before They Knock)

<details><summary><strong>Can ICE legally detain U.S. citizens?</strong></summary>
Yes—and it keeps happening. ICE has detained citizens by mistake (or indifference) for years. And in 2025, it's getting worse. With no central citizenship verification database and poor training, agents are detaining Americans based on bad data, accents, or assumptions <a href="https://nmpoliticalreport.com/2025/03/18/some-americans-have-already-been-caught-in-trumps-immigration-dragnet-more-will-be/">[13]</a>.
</details>

<details><summary><strong>Is it legal to fly with large amounts of cash?</strong></summary>
Absolutely. There is no federal law against carrying cash on domestic flights. But under civil forfeiture laws, the DEA can seize it anyway—without charges—just for being "suspicious" <a href="https://reason.com/2025/01/16/dea-ends-airport-gate-searches-after-years-of-documented-abuses-of-civil-asset-forfeiture/">[19]</a>, <a href="https://ij.org/case/dea-tsa-forfeitures/">[23]</a>.
</details>

<details><summary><strong>What is the 287(g) program and why is it dangerous?</strong></summary>
287(g) allows local cops to act as ICE agents. It’s been repeatedly linked to racial profiling and rights violations, especially in counties run by sheriffs with documented anti-immigrant bias <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/topic/stop-ice-from-empowering-racist-sheriffs-end-287g-agreements">[6]</a>, <a href="https://www.aclu.org/publications/license-abuse-how-ices-287g-program-empowers-racist-sheriffs">[7]</a>.
</details>

<details><summary><strong>Did any lawsuits actually stop federal abuse?</strong></summary>
Yes. The Institute for Justice’s class-action lawsuit helped kill the DEA’s Transportation Interdiction Program in 2025 [19]. And the ACLU forced ICE to release secret solitary confinement directives through FOIA litigation <a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-details-on-ices-solitary-confinement-policy-directive">[17]</a>.
</details>

<details><summary><strong>Could this happen to me if I’m a citizen?</strong></summary>
If you’re brown, foreign-sounding, politically outspoken—or unlucky—yes. U.S. citizens have been detained for less. And under current policies, ICE doesn’t need much of a reason <a href="https://nmpoliticalreport.com/2025/03/18/some-americans-have-already-been-caught-in-trumps-immigration-dragnet-more-will-be/">[13]</a>, <a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/court-rules-mahmoud-khalils-lawsuit-challenging-his-unlawful-detention-by-ice-should-move-forward-in-new-jersey">[14]</a>.

## You're the Target Now

Still think this doesn’t affect you?

- ICE already detained **U.S. citizens** in 2025.  
- The DEA took cash from **innocent travelers** and made them fight in court to get it back.  
- And the federal government is now deputizing agencies like **ATF and Marshals** to enforce **immigration law** they weren’t trained for.

This isn’t law enforcement.  

It’s a **loyalty test with badges**.

**Speak out?**
They'll use immigration policy to shut you up [14](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/court-rules-mahmoud-khalils-lawsuit-challenging-his-unlawful-detention-by-ice-should-move-forward-in-new-jersey).  

**Look brown?**
They’ll stop you at the gate and call it “national security” [13](https://nmpoliticalreport.com/2025/03/18/some-americans-have-already-been-caught-in-trumps-immigration-dragnet-more-will-be/).  

**Travel with your own money?**
They’ll take it and dare you to sue [19](https://reason.com/2025/01/16/dea-ends-airport-gate-searches-after-years-of-documented-abuses-of-civil-asset-forfeiture/).

The only thing standing between this government and total unaccountable enforcement is **litigation**, **cameras**, and **public exposure**.

If you’ve ever said “this can’t happen here,” open your eyes.  
**It already is.**
