## The Cuts They Promised Would Never Come

> ‚ÄúThe Trump Administration will not cut Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid benefits.‚Äù  
> ‚ÄîDonald J. Trump, March 11, 2025

This was the promise‚Äîdelivered from podiums, press briefings, and campaign stages. Speaker Mike Johnson echoed it. So did Senate Finance Chair Mike Crapo and House Ways & Means Chair Jason Smith. **‚ÄúNo cuts,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúZero.‚Äù**

But the numbers don‚Äôt lie.

The FY2026 budget proposal slashes a combined **$1.2 trillion** from Medicare and Medicaid over 10 years. The result? **Up to 10 million Americans losing coverage**, the erosion of elder care protections, and the looming threat of automatic cuts to Medicare provider payments unless Congress intervenes.

Meanwhile, **Social Security remains untouched‚Äî*for now***‚Äîbut even it isn‚Äôt immune from administrative gutting and mounting fiscal pressure.

This blog breaks it all down: the promises, the math, and the quiet but massive transfer of wealth away from working families and toward the ultra-rich.

      <li><strong>$500 billion</strong> in automatic Medicare cuts could begin in 2026 alone.</li>
      <li><strong>$600‚Äì880 billion</strong> in Medicaid cuts could kick up to 10.3 million people off coverage.</li>
      <li><strong>States pick up the slack</strong>‚Äîto the tune of $78 billion in new costs, mostly hitting blue states.</li>
      <li><strong>Social Security spared for now,</strong> but agency gutting and long-term deficits suggest it‚Äôs next.</li>
      <li><strong>The rich win again:</strong> more tax breaks, less accountability, and zero sacrifice.</li>

## Broken Promises: What They Said

They said they wouldn‚Äôt touch your benefits. Again and again. On national TV. In official statements. On social media.

Now, just weeks later, they‚Äôve done the opposite‚Äîsilently rewriting the social contract behind closed doors.

> Spoiler: Every one of these promises is now contradicted by the actual legislation and budget math.

They didn‚Äôt just go back on their word. They designed the budget to hide the cuts under technocratic language‚Äî*‚Äúreforms,‚Äù ‚Äústreamlining,‚Äù ‚Äúfederal savings,‚Äù* and ‚ÄúPAYGO.‚Äù But when the Congressional Budget Office ran the numbers, the truth became impossible to deny:

> Millions will lose coverage. Seniors will lose protections. And once again, the ultra-rich won‚Äôt lose a dime.

## The Reality: What the FY2026 Budget Actually Does

### Medicare: Up to $500 Billion in Cuts

Despite repeated promises, the FY2026 budget places Medicare squarely on the chopping block through both **direct policy changes** and **automatic cuts triggered by deficit rules**.

### PAYGO Triggered: Automatic $500B Cuts to Medicare

Congressional Budget Office estimates show the FY2026 reconciliation bill increases the deficit by over $2.3 trillion. That triggers **Statutory PAYGO**, which mandates across-the-board cuts‚Äîexcept *Medicare isn‚Äôt exempt.*

<canvas id="medicareCutsChart" width="600" height="350"></canvas>

const ctx = document.getElementById('medicareCutsChart').getContext('2d');

  data: {
    labels: ['2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', '2034'],
    datasets: [{
      label: 'Projected Medicare Cuts (in $ Billions)',
      data: [45, 55, 60, 65, 70, 70, 65, 40, 30],
      backgroundColor: 'rgba(220, 53, 69, 0.7)',
    }]

    },
    scales: {
      y: {
        beginAtZero: true
      }
    }
  }
});
</script>

**Key Impact:**  
Unless Congress musters 60 votes to override PAYGO, Medicare will face **$500 billion in cuts over the next decade**, starting with **$45 billion in 2026**. These cuts include a 4% reduction to:

- Hospital reimbursements  
- Physician fees  
- Medicare Advantage plan payments  
- Standalone prescription drug plans

### Policy ‚ÄúTweaks‚Äù That Add Up

Here‚Äôs how the reconciliation bill and budget compound the harm:

| Policy Change | Description | Projected Effect |
|---------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Repeal of Nursing Home Staffing Rule** | Removes federal mandate for minimum staffing in nursing homes. | Endangers seniors‚Äô care standards. |
| **Medicare Eligibility Rollback for Immigrants** | Cuts coverage for lawful immigrants who‚Äôve paid into the system. | Loss of Medicare and ACA subsidies. |
| **Streamlined Enrollment Repealed** | Ends modernization of enrollment for low-income seniors. | 1.4 million may lose cost-sharing support (e.g., help with premiums). |
| **Physician Payment Reform** | Ties increases to 10‚Äì75% of the Medicare Economic Index, not full inflation. | Slower growth in physician reimbursement. |
| **Medicare APM Incentives** | Larger increases for doctors using alternative payment models. | Prioritizes cost-saving model over access. |

**Bottom line:**  
The cuts don‚Äôt just hit ‚Äúfraud and waste.‚Äù They gut protections and shift costs onto **seniors**, **immigrants**, and **providers**‚Äîwhile letting wealthier stakeholders remain untouched.

### Medicaid: The Biggest Cuts in U.S. History

Medicaid takes the deepest hit under the FY2026 budget‚Äî**between $600 and $880 billion** in cuts over 10 years.

These aren‚Äôt just trims. They‚Äôre structural overhauls that threaten to strip health coverage from up to **10.3 million people**, while forcing states to absorb billions in new costs.

          stepSize: 2
        }
      }
    }
  }
});
</script>

## What‚Äôs Getting Cut and How

| Policy Change | Description | Impact |
|---------------|-------------|--------|
| **Work Requirements** | Requires most adults 19‚Äì64 to work 80 hrs/month or prove exemption. | Millions may lose coverage due to paperwork, not actual employment status. |
| **Federal Match Cuts (FMAP)** | Slashes federal share for expansion states and lawful immigrants. | States shoulder more cost; cuts to education or safety net likely follow. |
| **Increased Cost-Sharing** | Allows states to charge up to $35 per visit. | Discourages care; hits working poor the hardest. |
| **Immigrant Restrictions** | Cuts eligibility for many lawful residents; limits retroactive coverage. | Legal residents lose safety net they‚Äôve paid into. |
| **More Frequent Eligibility Checks** | Requires states to verify income and status at least 2x/year. | Administrative churn leads to disenrollment and gaps in coverage. |
| **Long-Term Care Undermined** | Caps Medicaid state payments below Medicare rates. | Threatens nursing homes, disability care, and home-based services. |

## State Burden and the Domino Effect

States could face up to **$78 billion in added costs**. Most can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt cover the shortfall‚Äîespecially during recessions when Medicaid rolls grow and state revenues fall.

This means:

- Cuts to schools, public safety, and transit
- Higher uninsured rates
- Emergency rooms overwhelmed by preventable crises

And all of it‚Äî*engineered by design.*

  <figcaption class="caption mt-2 text-muted">"This isn‚Äôt policy. It‚Äôs punishment disguised as budgeting."</figcaption>
</figure>

## Social Security: Protected‚ÄîFor Now?

Social Security escapes direct cuts in the FY2026 budget. But don‚Äôt mistake that for safety.

What‚Äôs happening instead? **Restructuring. Downsizing. Slow bleed.**

The White House and GOP leaders claim they're ‚Äúprotecting‚Äù Social Security, while simultaneously slashing budgets for frontline services, outsourcing operations, and introducing AI automation at the expense of human access.

## What They‚Äôre Doing

| Change | Description | Hidden Impact |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **No Direct Benefit Cuts** | Social Security remains exempt from PAYGO. | For now, checks are safe‚Äîbut structural changes begin. |
| **SSA Staffing Cuts** | Reduces field office and phone support. | Longer wait times, slower processing, more errors. |
| **Tech & AI Overhaul** | Pushes digital-only services and automation. | Disproportionately hurts seniors, rural, and disabled populations. |
| **Office Closures** | Shutters SSA offices in ‚Äúlow-use‚Äù regions. | Access deserts for those without broadband or transport. |

<figure class="mb-6">
  <img src="/assets/images/2025/05/queen-5.jpeg" alt="Instagram card about Social Security not being safe if infrastructure is gutted" style="width:100%;max-width:700px;">
  <figcaption class="caption mt-2 text-muted">No, they didn‚Äôt cut checks. But they did cut the ability to get help when something goes wrong.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Who‚Äôs Protected vs. Who‚Äôs Targeted

| Program          | PAYGO Status       | Budget Cuts     | Restructuring     | Risk Level      |
|------------------|--------------------|------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| **Social Security** | ‚úÖ Exempt             | ‚ùå No direct cuts | ‚ö†Ô∏è Admin downsizing | üü° Medium (future pressure) |
| **Medicare**        | ‚ùå Not exempt         | ‚úÖ Up to $500B    | ‚úÖ Staffing repeal, eligibility rollback | üî¥ High |

## A Long-Term Warning

While Social Security is protected from **this year‚Äôs cuts**, its funding future isn‚Äôt secure:

- Trust Fund depletion looms by the mid-2030s without new revenue
- Current budget expands the deficit by **$2.3 trillion**, making pressure on entitlements inevitable
- If Medicare and Medicaid are already being gutted, Social Security may simply be next

<figure class="mb-6">

  <figcaption class="caption mt-2 text-muted">You wanted a tax break? Only the ultra-rich got one. Meanwhile, you're left hoping your benefits still exist in 10 years.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Follow the Money: Wealth Up, Pain Down

If this budget is about ‚Äúfiscal responsibility,‚Äù the math doesn‚Äôt show it.

The same bill that cuts healthcare for millions **balloons the federal deficit by $2.3 trillion**. But the pain isn‚Äôt spread equally.

While Medicare and Medicaid get gutted, spending explodes elsewhere:

- **$1 trillion** for the Pentagon  
- **$175 billion** for Homeland Security  
- **$0** for protecting vulnerable seniors and hospitals

At the same time, the GOP quietly renewed **corporate tax loopholes** and **capital gains exemptions**‚Äîtransferring billions to the top 1%.

## Austerity for You, Abundance for Them

| Budget Item | Net Change | Who Benefits |

| **Medicare** | ‚Äì$500B (automatic PAYGO cuts) | Wealthy investors in private insurance (Medicare Advantage margins protected) |
| **Medicaid** | ‚Äì$600‚Äì880B | Budget savings reallocated to cover tax breaks |
| **Defense Spending** | +$115B increase | Military contractors, surveillance firms |
| **Homeland Security** | +$27B increase | Border wall expansion, ICE enforcement, detention |
| **Corporate Tax Cuts** | Renewed & expanded | Billionaires, hedge funds, pass-through LLCs |

</figure>

## Structural Upward Redistribution

This isn‚Äôt just about budget lines‚Äîit‚Äôs about intent.

- **Healthcare cuts** disproportionately hit seniors, immigrants, and working-class Americans  
- **Wealth gains** go to the top 0.1% through capital gains, business pass-throughs, and corporate relief  
- **State burdens** grow, while federal protections vanish

This is what economists call a **regressive fiscal policy**‚Äîbut what millions of Americans will feel is simple:

> "I lost my coverage. They got another yacht."

## Who‚Äôs Telling the Truth?

It‚Äôs one thing to make a promise. It‚Äôs another to vote against it.

Let‚Äôs match their words to their actions‚Äîline by line.

| Speaker | What They Said | What They Did |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| **Mike Johnson** | ‚ÄúNo cuts to Medicaid.‚Äù | Voted for budget slashing $700B from Medicaid, including mandatory work requirements. |
| **Donald Trump** | ‚ÄúMedicare will not be cut.‚Äù | Signed off on a budget that triggers $500B in automatic PAYGO Medicare cuts. |
| **Jason Smith** | ‚ÄúWe are protecting benefits seniors count on.‚Äù | Helped advance repeal of Nursing Home Staffing Rule and streamlined cost-sharing enrollment. |
| **Mike Crapo** | ‚ÄúAbsolutely no reduction to benefits.‚Äù | Supported reconciliation bill shifting costs to states and cutting ACA credits. |

<figure class="mb-6">

  <figcaption class="caption mt-2 text-muted">They said ‚Äúno cuts.‚Äù Their votes said otherwise.</figcaption>
</figure>

## The Disinformation Playbook

The FY2026 budget uses euphemisms to mask the truth:

- ‚ÄúStreamlining enrollment‚Äù ‚Üí kicking people off  
- ‚ÄúReforms to promote work‚Äù ‚Üí paperwork traps  
- ‚ÄúSavings from program integrity‚Äù ‚Üí service closures and fewer staff  
- ‚ÄúNot touching benefits‚Äù ‚Üí shifting all costs to states, insurers, and patients

When the math exposes the message, language becomes a weapon.

<figure class="mb-6">
  <img src="/assets/images/2025/05/queen-3.jpeg" alt="Instagram post: not about politics, it's about survival" style="width:100%;max-width:700px;">
  <figcaption class="caption mt-2 text-muted">This isn‚Äôt about left vs. right. It‚Äôs about whether you can still afford insulin next year.</figcaption>
</figure>

## What You Can Do

The cuts are real. The consequences are immediate. But the fight isn‚Äôt over.

Here‚Äôs how you can push back:

- **Start prepping now.** Make sure your paperwork is airtight. Help older family members and neighbors do the same.
- **Call Congress.** Name names. Use this blog as your script.
- **Share this post.** Make the truth go viral before the budget does more damage.
- **Organize locally.** Cuts to Medicaid don‚Äôt just affect individuals‚Äîthey devastate hospitals, clinics, and care workers.

## Local Action = National Impact

If your hospital closes or your mom loses coverage, it won‚Äôt be because of some distant ‚Äúfederal realignment.‚Äù It‚Äôll be because of this budget. And unless people speak out‚Äîloudly‚Äîthat impact will only grow.

> **Call your representatives. Email them. Show up at their town halls.**  
> Let them know: *We heard what you promised. We see what you‚Äôre doing. We vote.*

**The best defense for your family‚Äôs future is the truth. And now you‚Äôve got it.**

## AudioTranscript

‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt touch your benefits.‚Äù
That was the promise.
From Trump. From Speaker Mike Johnson. From the GOP‚Äôs leadership.
No cuts to Medicare. No cuts to Medicaid. No cuts to Social Security.
Zero.

But now?
The FY twenty twenty-six budget slashes over one point two trillion dollars from Medicare and Medicaid over the next decade.
At least seven to ten million Americans are expected to lose coverage.
Medicare faces an automatic cut of five hundred billion dollars‚Äîunless Congress acts.
And Social Security, while technically untouched, is being quietly hollowed out through staffing cuts and office closures.

Let‚Äôs break it down.

First‚Äîwhat they said.
Trump, March eleventh, twenty twenty-five: ‚ÄúThe Trump Administration will not cut Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid benefits.‚Äù
Mike Johnson, same day: ‚ÄúNo cuts. Zero.‚Äù
Jason Smith: ‚ÄúWe are committed to protecting retirement benefits seniors count on.‚Äù
And Mike Crapo: ‚ÄúAbsolutely clear‚Ä¶ no reduction to benefits.‚Äù

Now‚Äîwhat they did.

The GOP‚Äôs reconciliation bill increases the deficit by two point three trillion dollars.
And that triggers PAYGO‚Äîautomatic spending cuts.
Social Security is exempt.
Medicare is not.

Medicare faces up to forty-five billion dollars in cuts next year alone.
Hospitals. Physician payments. Medicare Advantage plans. Prescription drugs. All slashed by four percent across the board.
That‚Äôs not a policy tweak. That‚Äôs an amputation.

And there‚Äôs more.
They repealed the Nursing Home Staffing Rule.
They kicked out lawful immigrants from Medicare coverage.
They ended automatic cost-sharing support for low-income seniors.
One point four million people could lose help paying their Medicare premiums.

Now let‚Äôs talk Medicaid‚Äîthe hardest hit of all.

Between six hundred and eight hundred eighty billion dollars in cuts.
The largest rollback of Medicaid in U.S. history.
Work requirements will throw millions off coverage‚Äîjust by getting caught in red tape.
States will be forced to pick up the slack‚Äîseventy-eight billion dollars‚Äô worth of new costs.
Retroactive coverage is eliminated. Cost-sharing is increased. And immigrants are once again left behind.

Social Security?
No cuts on paper. But offices are being closed. Staff are being laid off.
And the shift to automation means millions of seniors are left navigating complex systems alone.
This isn‚Äôt preservation. It‚Äôs passive erosion.

Meanwhile‚Äîwhere‚Äôs the money going?
Defense: one trillion dollars.
Homeland Security: one hundred seventy-five billion.
Tax breaks for the wealthy: expanded.
Corporate loopholes: renewed.
All while safety nets are gutted.

So let‚Äôs say it plainly.
This isn‚Äôt about tightening belts.
This is about transferring wealth‚Äîupward.
From seniors. From working families. From rural hospitals.
To billionaires. To contractors. To the donor class.

They told you one thing.
They did the opposite.
And now you‚Äôre the one paying for it.

But you‚Äôre not powerless.
Start prepping now‚Äîcheck your eligibility, review your documents, help others do the same.
Call Congress. Use this message as your script.
Share this story. Talk to your community.
Because Medicaid cuts don‚Äôt just hurt patients‚Äîthey shut down entire hospitals.
And once they‚Äôre gone, they don‚Äôt come back.

They‚Äôre counting on your silence.
Don‚Äôt give it to them.

We heard what they promised.
We see what they‚Äôre doing.
And we vote.
