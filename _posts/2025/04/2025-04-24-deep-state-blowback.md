## The Conspiracy Is Real‚ÄîJust Not The One You Think

> Stumbled on some interesting quotes today:
> "Most terrorists are false flag terrorists, or are created by our own security services. In the United States, every single terrorist incident we have had, has been a false flag, or has been an informant pushed on by the FBI. ‚Äú    
> -   David Steele, Marine Intelligence Officer and former CIA officer 
> 
> The CIA and FBI "are behind most, if not all terrorism."
> -  Ted Gunderson, former FBI Chief
> 
> "The CIA formed ISIS."
> - Wayne Madsen, former Naval Officer and NSA Officer
> 
> "The CIA is funding ISIS through secret Swiss Bank accounts."
> - Dr Scott Bennett, Army Intelligence Officer
> 
> "30 FBI agents checked into the Mandalay Bay Hotel, 2 days before the shooting in Las Vegas."
> -  Jim Stone, editor

Let‚Äôs get this out of the way:  
- **No**, the CIA didn‚Äôt stage the Mandalay Bay shooting.  
- **No**, there‚Äôs no evidence it was a ‚Äúfalse flag.‚Äù  
- **And no**, they‚Äôre not coming for your guns

(Also - can we stop pretending guns are needed to stand up against a tyrannical government? There's a tyrannical government right in front of our eyes and the people with the guns are cheering them on.)

But you know what *is* true?

The CIA has **destabilized entire regions of the world**, toppled democratically elected governments, armed jihadists, fueled civil wars, and directly caused the migrant crises the U.S. now pretends to be shocked by.

So if you're looking for conspiracy with a body count ‚Äî **Don't look to Vegas. Look to Tehran. Guatemala City. Saigon. Baghdad. Tripoli. Kabul.**

This post isn‚Äôt about defending the official story. It‚Äôs about burning the *unofficial* one to the ground‚Äîand replacing it with cold, brutal facts.  

The truth is worse than your uncle‚Äôs meme. **It‚Äôs documented, declassified, and weaponized.**

Let‚Äôs talk about the real deep state.

## **The Real Deep State**

You want to talk ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù?

The modern American empire got its black-ops license in 1947, when the **National Security Act** created the **CIA** and the **National Security Council**. Truman thought he was building an information hub‚Äîhe accidentally created a global coup machine [1](https://www.trumanlibrary.gov/education/presidential-inquiries/establishment-cia).

Within a few years, the CIA had already ditched its role as glorified analysts. Why analyze when you can assassinate?

That wasn‚Äôt a fringe drift‚Äîit was **by design**. Covert operations became standard toolkit for enforcing U.S. influence without the messy PR of sending Marines. 

That meant:
- Rigging foreign elections  
- Toppling democratically elected governments  
- Propping up dictators  
- Arming extremist groups  
- Flooding regions with weapons  
- And when that didn‚Äôt work‚Äîjust destabilizing the whole damn state

We‚Äôre not guessing. We know. Because **declassified documents** spilled the tea decades ago. You can read the CIA‚Äôs internal memos where they gamed out propaganda ops, assassination plans, and black-budget coups [2](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/dnsa-collections).

And they knew there‚Äôd be fallout. Even the CIA had a word for it: **blowback**‚Äîthe unintended consequences of secret operations coming back to bite the US in the ass [3](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/events/iran-mosaddeq-overthrow-1953).

You‚Äôd think we‚Äôd have learned. Instead, the U.S. has run this script **over 70 times** since 1945‚Äîeach one a grenade we tossed into someone else‚Äôs living room, then acted surprised when refugees showed up on our porch [4](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/natsec/R42738.pdf).

Let‚Äôs stop pretending the CIA is some rogue faction hiding in the shadows. It‚Äôs a fully legalized wrecking crew, funded by Congress, protected by presidents, and praised by pundits‚Äîright up until the blowback hits.

## How to Steal a Country in Three Easy Steps (CIA Edition)

The U.S. didn‚Äôt become a global superpower by minding its own business. It did it by flipping governments like used Hondas at a cartel auction. And guess who had the keys? The CIA.

From the Cold War onward, the US's foreign policy tool of choice hasn‚Äôt been diplomacy‚Äîit‚Äôs been sabotage. Democracies, dictatorships, didn‚Äôt matter. If you got in the way of U.S. interests‚Äîespecially oil or anti-communism‚Äîyou got regime-changed.

**Step 1: Call them a communist**  
It didn‚Äôt matter if they were democratically elected, socialist, nationalist, or just inconvenient. The CIA‚Äôs first move was always to slap the red scare label on them. Iran‚Äôs Mossadegh? Nationalized British oil. Guatemala‚Äôs √Årbenz? Wanted land reform. Chile‚Äôs Allende? Tried taxing copper profits. All ‚Äúcommunists.‚Äù All gone.

**Step 2: Destabilize the economy**  
Next came the squeeze. Block loans. Crash their currency. Tank commodity prices. Fund strikes. If the CIA could make bread cost a day‚Äôs wages and blame it on the regime, they did. This tactic worked like a charm in Chile, where Nixon literally told the CIA to ‚Äúmake the economy scream‚Äù <a href="https://www.trumanlibrary.gov/education/presidential-inquiries/establishment-cia">[1]</a>.

**Step 3: Stage a coup, install a puppet**  
Once the target was weak and isolated, the CIA moved in. They funneled cash to opposition parties, armed militias, bribed generals, and unleashed propaganda to justify a coup. Iran in 1953, Guatemala in 1954, Chile in 1973‚Äîsame playbook, different continent. All resulted in U.S.-friendly regimes‚Äîand brutal authoritarian rule <a href="https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/dnsa-collections">[2]</a>.

And these weren‚Äôt isolated incidents. They were *policy*.

According to the Congressional Research Service, the U.S. has launched **469 foreign military interventions since 1798**, with **251 since just 1991** <a href="https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/events/iran-mosaddeq-overthrow-1953">[3]</a>. Most weren‚Äôt Iraq-level invasions. They were low-cost, high-deniability operations. The kind the CIA was built for.

The blowback? Oh, we‚Äôll get there. But first, let‚Äôs talk about who paid the price.

## You Break It, They Flee It: How U.S. Interventions Fueled the Migrant Crisis

Every time a U.S. administration ‚Äúliberates‚Äù a country, refugees start running the other way. Funny how that works.

Let‚Äôs talk Guatemala. After the CIA overthrew its elected government in 1954 to protect the United Fruit Company‚Äôs banana monopoly <a href="#sources">[2]</a>, the country plunged into a brutal 36-year civil war. U.S.-backed death squads wiped out entire indigenous villages <a href="#sources">[2]</a>. The civil war left more than 200,000 dead and drove generations of Guatemalans north. Today, Guatemala is still one of the top sources of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Same story in El Salvador. Same in Honduras. The U.S. pumped money and weapons into military regimes that disappeared students and dumped bodies in rivers. Want to know why so many Salvadorans and Hondurans are seeking asylum today? Because our Cold War "freedom crusade" made their home countries unlivable <a href="#sources">[2]</a>.

Then came Iraq. Then Libya. Then Syria. Whole regions flattened. Governments shattered. Power vacuums filled by warlords and militias. Millions displaced. Millions more starving. And guess what? They‚Äôre not staying put for your convenience. They‚Äôre fleeing‚Äîto Europe, to the U.S., to anywhere not bombed into the Stone Age by a superpower trying to ‚Äúrestore order.‚Äù

So next time a buffoon yells ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt they stay in their own countries?‚Äù maybe ask him how many coups, drone strikes, and IMF shock therapy plans he thinks their countries can survive first.

## The Jihad Frankenstein: How U.S. Foreign Policy Built a Monster

You don‚Äôt get 9/11, ISIS, or the Taliban without one thing: American foreign policy.

Let‚Äôs rewind. In the 1980s, the CIA funneled billions of dollars into Afghanistan to give the Soviet Union ‚Äúits own Vietnam.‚Äù The strategy? Arm the Mujahideen and let them bleed Moscow dry. It worked. Sort of. The Soviets got wrecked. But so did Afghanistan. And out of the rubble came a little group you may have heard of: the Taliban. And then, Al-Qaeda <a href="#sources">[2]</a>.

We didn't just arm them. We radicalized them. We helped print jihadi schoolbooks promoting holy war‚Äîwith U.S. taxpayer dollars <a href="#sources">[2]</a>. The CIA handed Stinger missiles to warlords, while the ISI (Pakistan‚Äôs intelligence agency, our ‚Äúally‚Äù) handed them to the most extreme factions they could find. Nothing says ‚Äúlong-term stability‚Äù like handing advanced weaponry to people who think music is satanic.

ISIS didn‚Äôt just materialize out of thin air. It came out of the ashes of Iraq and spread through the chaos of Libya and Syria‚Äîthree countries shattered by U.S. intervention. The people we funded to fight the Soviets became the same people who turned their weapons on us. The guys we ‚Äúliberated‚Äù from Saddam became recruits for jihad. The weapons we dropped in Libya ended up in the hands of terrorists in Mali and Niger.

Hello, cause and effect. You arm the world, destabilize it, then act surprised when it explodes in your face.

Still think ‚Äúthey hate us for our freedom‚Äù?

## From Junta to Ju√°rez: How CIA Coups Birthed Today‚Äôs Border Crisis

When conservatives rant about ‚Äúillegals‚Äù flooding the southern border, they‚Äôre screaming at the smoke, not the fire.

Let‚Äôs spell it out: the U.S. didn't just destabilize Central America. We detonated it.

The 1954 CIA-backed coup in Guatemala didn‚Äôt just topple President √Årbenz‚Äîit detonated a 36-year civil war. The regimes that followed, propped up by American money and training, massacred 200,000 people‚Äîmany of them Indigenous Maya [2](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/dnsa-collections). A quarter-million fled. Sound familiar?

El Salvador? Same playbook. The U.S. spent the 1980s funneling over $4.5 billion into a military dictatorship and death squads that left over 75,000 dead [4](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/natsec/R42738.pdf). Honduras became a staging ground for the CIA‚Äôs Nicaraguan Contra ops‚Äîturning it into the narco-state launching pad it is today.

The result? Millions displaced. Families gutted. Generations traumatized. These people didn‚Äôt ‚Äúinvade‚Äù the U.S. They fled nations we wrecked‚Äînations we kept wrecking long after the Cold War ended.

This isn‚Äôt ancient history. In fact, U.S. foreign policy today still operates like it's 1985, just with shinier drones and a bigger PR team.

## From Mujahideen to Manhattan

The United States didn‚Äôt invent Islamic extremism. But it *did* supercharge it‚Äîweaponize it, fund it, and call it freedom. And it all started in Afghanistan.

When the Soviet Union rolled into Kabul in 1979, Washington smelled blood. The Cold War was stalling, and Afghanistan was the perfect place to bleed the Soviets dry. Enter **Operation Cyclone**‚Äîa CIA-run, Pakistani-directed, Saudi-funded arms pipeline to the Afghan Mujahideen.

Here‚Äôs what that looked like:

The CIA didn‚Äôt directly hand Osama bin Laden a check. But they sure as hell built the world he thrived in.

- **$3+ billion** in covert support went through Pakistan‚Äôs ISI <a href="https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/dnsa-collections">[2]</a>.
- That support heavily favored *radical* factions like Gulbuddin Hekmatyar‚Äôs Hezb-e-Islami‚Äînot moderates.
- U.S.-funded schoolbooks taught Afghan kids jihad, complete with illustrations of weapons and martyrdom <a href="https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/dnsa-collections">[2]</a>.

When the Soviets limped out in 1989, the U.S. did too. Afghanistan collapsed into civil war. The Taliban took power. And the "Afghan Arabs"‚Äîforeign fighters like bin Laden‚Äîkept the jihad alive. Only now, the target wasn‚Äôt Moscow. It was us.

The World Trade Center. Twice.

## How the Iraq War Turned Blowback into a Firestorm

By 2003, the CIA had already laid the kindling. All it took was the Bush administration to light the match‚Äîand they did it with a flamethrower.

The invasion of Iraq wasn‚Äôt just a blunder. It was an accelerant. Sold on lies about weapons of mass destruction and bogus Saddam‚ÄìAl Qaeda connections, the U.S. toppled a secular dictator who, for all his brutality, kept a lid on sectarian chaos. Then we smashed the state into pieces and walked away like we hadn‚Äôt just unleashed hell.

### The Two Orders That Broke Iraq

L. Paul Bremer, the man in charge of post-invasion Iraq, issued two orders that practically built ISIS from scratch:

- **CPA Order 1: De-Baathification.** Fired tens of thousands of civil servants, teachers, and technocrats just for being associated with Saddam‚Äôs party. Goodbye institutional memory. Hello bitterness and unemployment.
- **CPA Order 2: Dissolution of the Iraqi Army.** Took 400,000 armed, trained, suddenly unpaid soldiers and left them with zero future. Guess where they went?

Straight into the arms of Zarqawi‚Äôs insurgency. Many of them became the military backbone of what would morph into the Islamic State of Iraq, and eventually ISIS <a href="https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/dnsa-collections">[2]</a>.

### ISIS: Made in America (Sort Of)

Zarqawi‚Äôs group, Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), weaponized Sunni rage and sectarian divide. By 2006, they were bombing Shiite mosques, slaughtering civilians, and baiting a civil war. The U.S. "surge" tamped things down temporarily, but the damage was done.

By 2011, when U.S. troops finally left, AQI had evolved into ISIS. And when Syria descended into civil war, ISIS found its golden opportunity to metastasize into a cross-border jihadist death cult.

Want to know how we got ISIS? It wasn‚Äôt because ‚Äúthey hate our freedom.‚Äù It‚Äôs because we bulldozed Iraq, tossed the pieces to the wind, and left the region to burn.

## From Migrants to Monsters: How U.S. Foreign Policy Bitters Its Own States

You can‚Äôt destabilize a continent and then complain when the fallout shows up at your doorstep. But that‚Äôs exactly what Republicans are doing.

For decades, U.S. policy turned Central America into a war zone and then acted shocked when people fled the carnage. Refugees from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras‚Äîthey weren‚Äôt just looking for work. They were escaping narco-states, gang wars, and death squads, many of which *we funded* [2](#sources).

Now those same red states that cheered the invasions, funded the coups, and waved the flag for ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù are losing their minds over asylum seekers showing up at their borders.

### The Irony Is Biblical

Let‚Äôs recap:

- Texas Republicans pushed for tough-on-crime, tough-on-drugs policies that fueled mass incarceration at home and militarization abroad.
- They cheered Reagan‚Äôs crusade in Nicaragua, Bush‚Äôs war on terror, and Trump‚Äôs border militarism.
- They cut foreign aid, gutted diplomatic support, and made sure there was no ‚Äúnation building‚Äù after the bombs fell.

And now? They‚Äôre footing the bill for refugee housing, border security, and local policing in their own states.

The backlash? It‚Äôs eating them alive.

Want to stop the migrant surge? Maybe stop lighting the fuse in the first place.

Because you can‚Äôt carpet-bomb a hemisphere and then whine when the smoke drifts back across the Rio Grande.

## When the Migrants Come Knocking

Let‚Äôs say the quiet part out loud: **We broke it. They‚Äôre here to collect.**

You don‚Äôt get to spend decades **toppling governments**, **arming death squads**, and **collapsing economies**‚Äîthen act surprised when people flee the smoldering wreckage you left behind.

And yet, every election cycle, U.S. politicians froth at the mouth over a ‚Äúborder crisis‚Äù **as if it fell out of the sky**. Like Hondurans and Salvadorans just *woke up one day* and decided to walk a thousand miles for shits and giggles.

Let‚Äôs connect the dots:

  }
</style>

</div>

Now? The same politicians who funded the bombs are crying about the refugees.

Worse: they‚Äôre blaming *the migrants* for a crisis **we created**.

So what‚Äôs the actual cost?

- **Border spending has more than tripled** since 2000 <a href="https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/dnsa-collections">[2]</a>.
- We‚Äôre dumping **over $25 billion a year** on enforcement while claiming we ‚Äúcan‚Äôt afford‚Äù processing centers or asylum judges <a href="https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/dnsa-collections">[2]</a>.
- **1 in 3** migrants arriving now are from countries directly impacted by U.S. regime change and military ops.

Not a border crisis. **A blowback crisis.**

Want fewer people at the border?

Stop burning their countries down.

## What Happens When You Burn the Bridge You Bombed?

The U.S. spent 70 years turning Latin America into a neoliberal testing ground and proxy war sandbox. Now that the blowback has arrived on our doorstep, Republicans are treating it like a biblical plague rather than the man-made disaster it is.

We destabilized their countries, and now we criminalize them for fleeing the wreckage.

Let‚Äôs get this straight:

- Most of today‚Äôs ‚Äúborder crisis‚Äù migrants aren‚Äôt from Mexico. They‚Äôre from countries the U.S. helped wreck‚ÄîGuatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Venezuela, and Haiti <a href="#sources">[2]</a>.
- 90% of asylum seekers at the border are fleeing generalized violence, state collapse, or persecution‚Äîthe same ingredients we‚Äôve stirred into their regions for decades <a href="#sources">[4]</a>.
- And despite the panic, net migration from Mexico has been *negative* for years. The so-called ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù is largely a delayed consequence of U.S. policy chickens coming home to roost <a href="#sources">[3]</a>.

It‚Äôs karma, not a mystery border crisis.

It‚Äôs why no amount of border walls, barbed wire, or MAGA theatrics will ‚Äúsolve‚Äù the problem. You can‚Äôt deport your way out of a foreign policy hangover.

## The Conspiracy That Wasn't a Theory

Let's recap. Your MAGA uncle thinks the CIA staged a mass shooting to push gun control.

Cute theory.

Meanwhile, the CIA was busy toppling governments, igniting civil wars, and handing missiles to jihadists. Not in secret Reddit threads‚Äî**in declassified memos, budget appropriations, and presidential briefings**.

They didn‚Äôt need crisis actors. They had actual crises. They didn‚Äôt fake carnage. They *funded it*.

This isn‚Äôt QAnon fanfiction. This is empire in action.

So next time someone tells you the ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù is a fantasy? Remind them it‚Äôs not a fantasy. It‚Äôs a r√©sum√©. And the body count is very, very real.

Want fewer migrants at the border? Fewer jihadists online? Fewer terrorist attacks at home?

Maybe start by closing the foreign policy blender that turned the world into a refugee factory and handed the fallout to ICE.

Because the real conspiracy?

**We already know it happened.**

## AudioTranscript

You‚Äôre looking for conspiracies in the wrong place.

No, the CIA didn‚Äôt stage the Mandalay Bay shooting. They didn‚Äôt need to. They were too busy toppling governments, arming jihadists, and turning entire countries into failed states.

That migrant caravan your uncle screams about on Facebook? That‚Äôs not a plot by Soros. That‚Äôs blowback from U.S. foreign policy.

Let‚Äôs get real.

The CIA has destabilized regions from Tehran to Tripoli. They‚Äôve overthrown elected leaders, propped up dictators, flooded conflict zones with weapons, and trained death squads like it was a retirement hobby.

This isn‚Äôt fringe paranoia. This is documented, declassified fact. You can read the CIA‚Äôs own memos if you‚Äôve got the stomach.

You want the real conspiracy?

It's not a fake shooting. It‚Äôs a black-budget machine that‚Äôs been running coups since 1947. Truman created the CIA. By the ‚Äò50s, it was already running foreign elections like a Vegas casino‚Äîrigged and well-funded.

Here‚Äôs how it works:
Step one‚Äîcall them communists.
Step two‚Äîcrash their economy.
Step three‚Äîstage a coup and install a puppet.
And if that fails? Blow the whole damn country up and walk away.

Iran. Guatemala. Chile. Nicaragua. Iraq. Libya. Syria.

Each one a spark that lit a region on fire. And guess who gets to deal with the refugees?

We do.

Guatemalans fleeing a civil war we started. Hondurans fleeing narco-states we helped arm. Syrians and Iraqis escaping the rubble of our airstrikes and regime change experiments.

And Republicans have the gall to call it an invasion?

You can‚Äôt destabilize half the planet and then clutch your pearls when the smoke drifts across your border.

It‚Äôs not a border crisis. It‚Äôs a blowback crisis.

ISIS? That wasn‚Äôt born in a vacuum. That came from Iraq‚Äîafter we toppled Saddam, disbanded the army, and tossed 400,000 pissed-off guys with guns into the streets.

Al-Qaeda? That was the thank-you card from the Mujahideen after Operation Cyclone. We handed them missiles and jihadi textbooks in the ‚Äò80s to fight the Soviets. Then they pointed those weapons at us.

You want fewer terrorists? Maybe stop creating the conditions that breed them.

And red states‚Äîdon‚Äôt think you‚Äôre off the hook. You cheered every war, cut every foreign aid budget, and now you‚Äôre crying about asylum claims.

Texas is spending over a billion a year on border militarization. California? A fraction of that‚Äîinvesting in actual immigration services. One‚Äôs a panic show. The other‚Äôs a policy.

And here‚Äôs the kicker: immigrants in red states pay more in taxes than they cost in services. Deport them, and your economy crashes harder than crypto in a bear market.

But this isn‚Äôt about facts, is it?

It‚Äôs about fear. Spectacle. Blaming brown people for problems white guys in suits created.

So here‚Äôs the truth bomb:

The CIA didn‚Äôt need crisis actors. They had real ones‚Äîwith real weapons and real body counts. They didn‚Äôt fake carnage. They funded it.

Still think the deep state is a theory?

It‚Äôs not a theory. It‚Äôs the r√©sum√© of an empire.

You want to stop the chaos?

Stop lighting the damn match.
