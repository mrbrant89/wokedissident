## The Conspiracy Is Real—Just Not The One You Think

> Stumbled on some interesting quotes today:
> "Most terrorists are false flag terrorists, or are created by our own security services. In the United States, every single terrorist incident we have had, has been a false flag, or has been an informant pushed on by the FBI. “    
> -   David Steele, Marine Intelligence Officer and former CIA officer 
> 
> The CIA and FBI "are behind most, if not all terrorism."
> -  Ted Gunderson, former FBI Chief
> 
> "The CIA formed ISIS."
> - Wayne Madsen, former Naval Officer and NSA Officer
> 
> "The CIA is funding ISIS through secret Swiss Bank accounts."
> - Dr Scott Bennett, Army Intelligence Officer
> 
> "30 FBI agents checked into the Mandalay Bay Hotel, 2 days before the shooting in Las Vegas."
> -  Jim Stone, editor

Let’s get this out of the way:  
- **No**, the CIA didn’t stage the Mandalay Bay shooting.  
- **No**, there’s no evidence it was a “false flag.”  
- **And no**, they’re not coming for your bump stock.

But you know what *is* true?

The CIA has **destabilized entire regions of the world**, toppled democratically elected governments, armed jihadists, fueled civil wars, and directly caused the migrant crises the U.S. now pretends to be shocked by.

So if you're looking for conspiracy with a body count — **Don't look to Vegas. Look to Tehran. Guatemala City. Saigon. Baghdad. Tripoli. Kabul.**

This post isn’t about defending the official story. It’s about burning the *unofficial* one to the ground—and replacing it with cold, brutal facts.  

The truth is worse than your uncle’s meme. **It’s documented, declassified, and weaponized.**

Let’s talk about the real deep state.

## **The Real Deep State**

You want to talk “deep state”?

The modern American empire got its black-ops license in 1947, when the **National Security Act** created the **CIA** and the **National Security Council**. Truman thought he was building an information hub—he accidentally created a global coup machine [1](https://www.trumanlibrary.gov/education/presidential-inquiries/establishment-cia).

Within a few years, the CIA had already ditched its role as glorified analysts. Why analyze when you can assassinate?

That wasn’t some fringe drift—it was **by design**. Covert operations became standard toolkit for enforcing U.S. influence without the messy PR of sending Marines. That meant:
- Rigging foreign elections  
- Toppling democratically elected governments  
- Propping up dictators  
- Arming extremist groups  
- Flooding regions with weapons  
- And when that didn’t work—just destabilizing the whole damn state

We’re not guessing. We know. Because **declassified documents** spilled the tea decades ago. You can read the CIA’s internal memos where they gamed out propaganda ops, assassination plans, and black-budget coups [2](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/dnsa-collections).

And they knew there’d be fallout. Even the CIA had a word for it: **blowback**—the unintended consequences of secret operations coming back to bite America in the ass [3](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/events/iran-mosaddeq-overthrow-1953).

You’d think we’d have learned. Instead, the U.S. ran this script **over 70 times** since 1945—each one a grenade we tossed into someone else’s living room, then acted surprised when refugees showed up on our porch [4](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/natsec/R42738.pdf).

Let’s stop pretending the CIA is some rogue faction hiding in the shadows. It’s a fully legalized wrecking crew, funded by Congress, protected by presidents, and praised by pundits—right up until the blowback hits.

## How to Steal a Country in Three Easy Steps (CIA Edition)

The U.S. didn’t become a global superpower by minding its own business. It did it by flipping governments like used Hondas at a cartel auction. And guess who had the keys? The CIA.

From the Cold War onward, America’s foreign policy tool of choice hasn’t been diplomacy—it’s been sabotage. Democracies, dictatorships, didn’t matter. If you got in the way of U.S. interests—especially oil or anti-communism—you got regime-changed.

**Step 1: Call them a communist**  
It didn’t matter if they were democratically elected, socialist, nationalist, or just inconvenient. The CIA’s first move was always to slap the red scare label on them. Iran’s Mossadegh? Nationalized British oil. Guatemala’s Árbenz? Wanted land reform. Chile’s Allende? Tried taxing copper profits. All “communists.” All gone.

**Step 2: Destabilize the economy**  
Next came the squeeze. Block loans. Crash their currency. Tank commodity prices. Fund strikes. If the CIA could make bread cost a day’s wages and blame it on the regime, they did. This tactic worked like a charm in Chile, where Nixon literally told the CIA to “make the economy scream” [1].

**Step 3: Stage a coup, install a puppet**  
Once the target was weak and isolated, the CIA moved in. They funneled cash to opposition parties, armed militias, bribed generals, and unleashed propaganda to justify a coup. Iran in 1953, Guatemala in 1954, Chile in 1973—same playbook, different continent. All resulted in U.S.-friendly regimes—and brutal authoritarian rule [2].

</figure>

And these weren’t isolated incidents. They were *policy*.

According to the Congressional Research Service, the U.S. has launched **469 foreign military interventions since 1798**, with **251 since just 1991** [3]. Most weren’t Iraq-level invasions. They were low-cost, high-deniability operations. The kind the CIA was built for.

The blowback? Oh, we’ll get there. But first, let’s talk about who paid the price.

## You Break It, They Flee It: How U.S. Interventions Fueled the Migrant Crisis

Every time a U.S. administration “liberates” a country, refugees start running the other way. Funny how that works.

Let’s talk Guatemala. After the CIA overthrew its elected government in 1954 to protect the United Fruit Company’s banana monopoly <a href="#sources">[2]</a>, the country plunged into a brutal 36-year civil war. U.S.-backed death squads wiped out entire indigenous villages. That’s not hyperbole—that’s the truth, straight out of declassified archives <a href="#sources">[2]</a>. The civil war left more than 200,000 dead and drove generations of Guatemalans north. Today, Guatemala is still one of the top sources of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Same story in El Salvador. Same in Honduras. The U.S. pumped money and weapons into military regimes that disappeared students and dumped bodies in rivers. Want to know why so many Salvadorans and Hondurans are seeking asylum today? Because our Cold War "freedom crusade" made their home countries unlivable <a href="#sources">[2]</a>.

Then came Iraq. Then Libya. Then Syria. Whole regions flattened. Governments shattered. Power vacuums filled by warlords and militias. Millions displaced. Millions more starving. And guess what? They’re not staying put for your convenience. They’re fleeing—to Europe, to the U.S., to anywhere not bombed into the Stone Age by a superpower trying to “restore order.”

So next time some mouth-breather yells “Why don’t they stay in their own countries?” maybe ask him how many coups, drone strikes, and IMF shock therapy plans he thinks their countries can survive first.

## The Jihad Frankenstein: How U.S. Foreign Policy Built a Monster

You don’t get 9/11, ISIS, or the Taliban without one thing: American foreign policy.

Let’s rewind. In the 1980s, the CIA funneled billions of dollars into Afghanistan to give the Soviet Union “its own Vietnam.” The strategy? Arm the Mujahideen and let them bleed Moscow dry. It worked. Sort of. The Soviets got wrecked. But so did Afghanistan. And out of the rubble came a little group you may have heard of: the Taliban. And then, Al-Qaeda <a href="#sources">[2]</a>.

We didn't just arm them. We radicalized them. We helped print jihadi schoolbooks promoting holy war—with U.S. taxpayer dollars <a href="#sources">[2]</a>. The CIA handed Stinger missiles to warlords, while the ISI (Pakistan’s intelligence agency, our “ally”) handed them to the most extreme factions they could find. Because nothing says “long-term stability” like handing advanced weaponry to people who think music is satanic.

ISIS didn’t just materialize out of thin air. It came out of the ashes of Iraq and spread through the chaos of Libya and Syria—three countries shattered by U.S. intervention. The people we funded to fight the Soviets became the same people who turned their weapons on us. The guys we “liberated” from Saddam became recruits for jihad. The weapons we dropped in Libya ended up in the hands of terrorists in Mali and Niger.

This isn’t a conspiracy. This is cause and effect. You arm the world, destabilize it, then act surprised when it explodes in your face.

Still think “they hate us for our freedom”?

Absolutely—here's your next section, building on the coup playbook and moving us squarely into the **migrant crisis blowback** angle. We're hitting harder now, connecting CIA games abroad with real consequences at the border.

## From Junta to Juárez: How CIA Coups Birthed Today’s Border Crisis

When conservatives rant about “illegals” flooding the southern border, they’re screaming at the smoke, not the fire.

Let’s spell it out: the U.S. didn't just destabilize Central America. We detonated it.

The 1954 CIA-backed coup in Guatemala didn’t just topple President Árbenz—it detonated a 36-year civil war. The regimes that followed, propped up by American money and training, massacred 200,000 people—many of them Indigenous Maya [2](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/dnsa-collections). A quarter-million fled. Sound familiar?

El Salvador? Same playbook. The U.S. spent the 1980s funneling over $4.5 billion into a military dictatorship and death squads that left over 75,000 dead [4](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/natsec/R42738.pdf). Honduras became a staging ground for the CIA’s Nicaraguan Contra ops—turning it into the narco-state launching pad it is today.

The result? Millions displaced. Families gutted. Generations traumatized. These people didn’t “invade” the U.S. They fled nations we wrecked—nations we kept wrecking long after the Cold War ended.

## From Mujahideen to Manhattan

The United States didn’t invent Islamic extremism. But it *did* supercharge it—weaponize it, fund it, and call it freedom. And it all started in Afghanistan.

When the Soviet Union rolled into Kabul in 1979, Washington smelled blood. The Cold War was stalling, and Afghanistan was the perfect place to bleed the Soviets dry. Enter **Operation Cyclone**—a CIA-run, Pakistani-directed, Saudi-funded arms pipeline to the Afghan Mujahideen.

Here’s what that looked like:

</figure>

The CIA didn’t directly hand Osama bin Laden a check. But they sure as hell built the world he thrived in.

- **$3+ billion** in covert support went through Pakistan’s ISI [2].
- That support heavily favored *radical* factions like Gulbuddin Hekmatyar’s Hezb-e-Islami—not moderates.
- U.S.-funded schoolbooks taught Afghan kids jihad, complete with illustrations of weapons and martyrdom [2].

When the Soviets limped out in 1989, America did too. Afghanistan collapsed into civil war. The Taliban took power. And the "Afghan Arabs"—foreign fighters like bin Laden—kept the jihad alive. Only now, the target wasn’t Moscow. It was us.

The World Trade Center. Twice.
