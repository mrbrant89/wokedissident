## The Numbers Don’t Lie—But They Do Bleed

The U.S. travel industry was crawling its way out of the pandemic crater. By 2024, international tourism was up 9.1% over the previous year—**72.4 million visitors** came to spend their money here. Still, we were **8.9% short of 2019 levels** <a href="https://www.travelpulse.com/news/destinations/national-travel-tourism-office-2025-forecast-predicts-us-to-welcome-over-77-million-international-visitors">[1]</a>.

And just when things were finally rebounding?

Trump came back with a vengeance. And the numbers are already bleeding.

Europe passed its pre-COVID tourism levels in 2024. The U.S.? Still lagging behind. And unlike a virus, **you can’t vaccinate your way out of stupidity**.

While Europe was popping champagne, the U.S. was strip-searching teenagers in Honolulu.

Even worse, **Canada**, our snowbird neighbor and economic lifeline, has stopped showing up. Spring break in Florida usually means a flood of Canadians escaping the cold—families, retirees, college kids. Not this year. In 2025, Canadian travel to Florida cratered. Advance airline bookings for the summer are **down over 70%** compared to 2024. And spring break? **A ghost town.** 

Toronto Pearson—one of the busiest airports in the world—had **a completely empty U.S. pre-clearance zone**. Dozens of immigration kiosks, not a single traveler in line. For those who can read the room, that looks a lot like a boycott. And the excuse? It’s not the weather. It’s not inflation. It’s the vibe. The growing fear that crossing into Trump’s America means risking your privacy, your plans—or your freedom.

The numbers tell the story: Trump’s America is becoming a no-fly zone—not because people can’t come, but because they don’t want to.

Meanwhile, some of America’s top markets—France, the UK, Australia—are still sending **fewer visitors than in 2019**. Others, like India, are surging. But how long until they, too, start canceling plans?

All it takes is one more viral headline of a tourist jailed for "not having a hotel booked."

The "Land of the Free" is looking more like the “Land of ‘We’ll See If We Let You In.’”

## Welcome to America—Please Strip for Entry

American hospitality, 2025 edition:  
Welcome. Smile for the mugshot. Unlock your phone. Strip. Explain your freelance gigs. Get deported anyway.

That’s not hyperbole. That’s what happened to **two German teenagers** who flew into Hawaii for a post-grad trip.

They were:
- **19 and 18 years old**
- Carrying **valid travel documents**
- Coming from **New Zealand**
- Planning to **backpack and explore**

Instead, they were **interrogated, strip-searched, forced into prison uniforms**, and **deported to Japan**. Their crime? Mentioning they *might* do some freelance work online while traveling. No U.S. clients. No intent to work illegally <a href="https://www.travelpulse.com/news/destinations/national-travel-tourism-office-2025-forecast-predicts-us-to-welcome-over-77-million-international-visitors">[1]</a>.

This bout spectacle - performative cruelty - not security. It’s a flex—a warning shot to the rest of the world: **don’t come here unless you're ready to be humiliated.**

And the agents doing it? **They don’t need a reason.** 

Under current rules:
- They can **search your phone** without probable cause <a href="https://flgov.com/eog/sites/default/files/shared/2025/02/Q4%202024%20Estimates%20Packet.pdf">[2]</a>.
- They can **detain you for “attitude.”**
- They can dig through your photos, texts, social media, and political views—then decide if you're "safe."

Even green card holders aren’t safe.  

Even U.S. citizens get grilled if they “seem foreign” enough.  

And tourists? They’re now expected to prove they’re not secretly bloggers or radicals.

## Spying on Tourists? That’s One Way to Tank an Industry

Want to scare off a tourist? Easy.  

Treat them like they’re trying to smuggle uranium every time they cross the border.

That’s exactly what the U.S. is doing. In 2025, **CBP ramped up its “search everything” policy**, digging through tourists’ phones, laptops, and even social media—with zero suspicion required.

And yes, they’re absolutely looking for **political opinions**.

**Here’s how it works:**
- If you're a tourist or visa holder, you **have fewer rights**.
- CBP agents can **ask you to unlock your phone**, and **you can be denied entry** if you refuse.
- They’ll scroll through your texts, dig through photos, and even inspect your **search history**.
- “Basic search” = no reason needed. Just vibes.

Feeling welcome yet?

**Quote from a French traveler, February 2025:**
> “They asked if I supported Trump. I said no. They pulled me into secondary. I missed my connection. I missed the whole week.”

And let’s talk about the vibe shift.

Tourists now share travel tips not about where to eat in NYC—but **how to hide political content** on your phone before landing:
- Use burner phones.
- Delete Twitter/X.
- Put devices in airplane mode.
- Never talk politics to an agent. Not even in jest.

      <tr><td>Don’t post about U.S. politics before flying</td><td>Social media vetting is real</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Avoid using WhatsApp or Signal</td><td>“Encrypted” = suspicious</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <figcaption>Welcome to America, where your vacation starts with a Fourth Amendment cavity search.</figcaption>
</figure>

And just to rub salt in it? This isn't even **effective** security.  
- These policies don’t catch terrorists.  
- They catch tourists who blog.  
- Students who protest.  
- Canadians who applied for a job.  
And **spend-happy travelers who were ready to dump $3,000 into Florida’s economy** before being told to go home.

All of this for what?

A headline that says "Tough on Borders" while the tourism sector bleeds out.

## Florida, You Played Yourself

Trump’s base isn’t in D.C., California or New York.

It’s in the red states living off mouse ears, frozen daiquiris, and sunburnt Canadians.  

And thanks to his border paranoia? They’re about to **lose their biggest cash cow**.

### Florida’s economy in one word: tourism.

- **$127.7 billion** in economic impact in 2023  
- **$14.9 billion** from international visitors alone  
- **12.2 million** overseas and Canadian tourists in 2024  
- **36.9 billion** in tax revenue, just from people coming to spend money and leave <a href="https://www.travelpulse.com/news/destinations/national-travel-tourism-office-2025-forecast-predicts-us-to-welcome-over-77-million-international-visitors">[1]</a>

Now imagine that vanishing.

    </tbody>
  </table>
  <figcaption>Red states bank on tourism. Trump’s burning their money to own the libs.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Canadian visits to Florida?  
**Still 20% below pre-pandemic levels**.  
**Spring 2025 traffic cratered**—Toronto Pearson’s U.S. customs hall sat empty during peak break season.  
**Q4 2024** was **32% below 2019**, and early **2025 bookings are worse**.  
<a href="https://flgov.com/eog/sites/default/files/shared/2025/02/Q4%202024%20Estimates%20Packet.pdf">[2]</a> 

### Airline bookings for summer 2025?  
**Canadian routes: down over 70%** <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20250423180/international-travelers-are-skipping-the-us-that-could-cost-americas-economy-90-billion">[3]</a>.  
Europe’s pulling back too.

This isn’t random.  

This is the price of hostile borders, phone seizures, and **news stories about German girls being jailed for booking a cheap hostel**.

- Tourists don’t want to take political quizzes.  
- They don’t want their devices ransacked.  
- They don’t want to wonder if a border agent will misread their couchsurfing trip as an “illegal work scheme.”

They just want Disney. And they’re choosing Paris over Orlando.

What does all this mean?

It means **Florida's DeSantis-voting, Trump-cheering, tourism-dependent economy is about to get wrecked by its own mascot.**

MAGA means business—until it means **losing it**.

## Congratulations, You Deported $90 Billion

Here’s the punchline of Trump’s second term border circus:  
**We didn’t just scare off some tourists—we nuked a $253.9 billion industry.**

Let’s talk numbers.

In 2024, international visitors:
- Spent **$253.9 billion** in the U.S.  
- Injected **$696 million per day** into the economy  
- Made travel the **#1 services export**—beating tech, finance, even Hollywood <a href="https://www.travelpulse.com/news/destinations/national-travel-tourism-office-2025-forecast-predicts-us-to-welcome-over-77-million-international-visitors">[1]</a>

And in 2025?

Analysts are slashing forecasts:
- **Tourism Economics** now predicts **$64 billion in losses**
- **Goldman Sachs** says it could hit **$90 billion** if sentiment keeps tanking <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20250423180/international-travelers-are-skipping-the-us-that-could-cost-americas-economy-90-billion">[3]</a>

  <figcaption>Trump 2.0 is costing us more than allies—it’s costing us GDP.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Why?

Because travel isn’t just a vacation.  

It’s:
- Thousands of hotels and restaurants
- Theme parks, tours, and ticketed events
- Local shops and family-run joints that live or die by foot traffic
- And **millions of jobs** in red states that thought they were voting to “protect the economy”

Instead, they voted to chase off paying customers. With cuffs, phones seizures, and visa purges.

And the ripple effect? Massive.

- **Business events cancelled**
- **Student enrollment dropping**
- **Conventions moved overseas**
- And red states left asking: “Why’s our tax revenue tanking?”

Spoiler: because you deported your income.

## How to Lose the World Cup Before the First Kick

You want to know how deep the damage goes?

Trump’s war on tourists isn’t just torching Florida’s GDP or chasing off French backpackers. It’s now threatening to get the **U.S. kicked out of its own World Cup**.

Seriously.

### FIFA is Worried. For Real.

Behind closed doors, FIFA is already discussing contingency plans to **move matches** or **shift the broadcast center** outside the U.S. if the political climate keeps deteriorating <a href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/sb-blogs/sbj-unpacks/2025/03/20/">[18]</a>. Organizers openly admit they’re walking a diplomatic tightrope with visas, security, and Trump’s blowtorch diplomacy. Canada and Mexico are quietly preparing to step in if needed. The IOC? Same vibes. Nervous emails, frantic calls, and contingency drills.

<figure>
  <table>
    <thead><tr><th>Host Country</th><th>Matches Scheduled</th><th>Backup Capacity</th><th>Risk Level</th></tr></thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>United States</td><td>78</td><td>Low</td><td>🔴 HIGH</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Canada</td><td>10</td><td>Medium</td><td>🟠 MODERATE</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Mexico</td><td>10</td><td>High</td><td>🟡 MODERATE-LOW</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <figcaption>FIFA reportedly evaluating Canada and Mexico for expanded hosting roles if U.S. chaos continues.</figcaption>
</figure>

Why the freakout? Because Trump’s policies threaten the **core logistics of these mega-events**:
- Visa delays
- Entry denials for athletes
- Retaliatory boycotts
- Shaky cross-border security

FIFA doesn’t care about MAGA. 

FIFA cares about **TV money** and **uninterrupted spectacle**. Trump screws that up? They’ll cut the cord.

### And Here Comes the Boycott Threat

The Olympics aren’t safe either.  

The International Olympic Committee has already flagged concerns about **“hostile border policies,”** **LGBTQ+ athlete treatment**, and **visa unpredictability** under Trump 2.0 <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ioc-olympics-president-election-issues-74e4be4e3f21ba0e97892b052434e510">[19]</a>.

Some allies—France, Germany, Australia—are **publicly warning travelers** about entering the U.S. <a href="https://travel.gc.ca/destinations/united-states">[20]</a>.  

Others are **quietly discussing participation conditions**.

        }
      }
    }
  }
});
</script>

This isn’t speculation.  

**We’ve seen this movie before.**  
- 1980: U.S. boycotts Moscow.  
- 1984: USSR boycotts Los Angeles.  

2028? Germany, France, Canada, Australia all rethink sending athletes to a country where:
- LGBTQ+ rights are under fire
- Tourists are detained for tweets
- Political speech gets you flagged at the border

And let’s not forget the **Olympic sponsors**, who are already skittish about associating their brands with authoritarian vibes. Visa, Coca-Cola, Samsung? They’ll bounce faster than a sprinter in a doping scandal if the headlines go nuclear.

### Sports Diplomacy Just Became a Liability

The Olympics and World Cup were supposed to be America’s big comeback. Instead, they might become **international incidents in Lycra**.

Want to know how fast global goodwill can evaporate?

Look at the travel advisories.

<figure>
  <table>
    <thead><tr><th>Country</th><th>2025 U.S. Advisory Risk</th><th>Updated Due To</th></tr></thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>Canada</td><td>⚠️ Heightened Caution</td><td>Border detentions, new registration rule</td></tr>
      <tr><td>UK</td><td>⚠️ High Terror Threat</td><td>Protest risk, mass shooting fears</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Germany</td><td>⚠️ Case-by-case advisories</td><td>Unpredictable entry enforcement</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Australia</td><td>⚠️ Avoid political events</td><td>Deportation risk for protest participation</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <figcaption>Allies don’t trust the U.S. border anymore. FIFA and the IOC are taking notes.</figcaption>
</figure>

### TL;DR: America might lose the very events it fought to host.

- Border paranoia is triggering security concerns.  
- Trump’s anti-immigrant posture is pissing off allies.  
- And the world is watching.

The irony?

We’re building Olympic stages and World Cup stadiums…  
…while our own politics might keep the world from showing up.

## We’re Not a Destination—We’re a Warning

Once upon a time, people dreamed of visiting America.  

Now they Google:  
> *“Can I get deported for being gay in the U.S.?”*  
> *“Can border patrol check my phone?”*  
> *“Why were German teens jailed in Hawaii?”*

This isn’t just a tourism slump, but a **reputation collapse**. And we did it to ourselves.

Every time Trump 2.0 throws red meat to the base with another border crackdown, the rest of the world sees a flashing red sign:

**“ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK.”**

And red states?  
- They’re not just collateral damage.  
- They’re the ones bleeding out first.

Florida’s about to learn that you can’t strip-search your way to prosperity.  

Texas will watch convention business vanish while shouting about "freedom."  

Nevada’s casinos will go quiet—not because people lost interest, but because they booked a cheaper, friendlier trip to Canada or Macau.

Tourism isn’t just about flights and hotel rooms.  

It’s about soft power.  

It’s about being a country people *want* to come to.

Right now?  
The U.S. is acting more like a closed compound than the “land of the free.”

So congratulations, America.  
You turned the American Dream into a customs nightmare.  
You scared off your own income.

And now? 

You’re wide open for the one thing tourists hate more than long lines and TSA patdowns:

**Irrelevance.**

## AudioTranscript

Trump’s second term isn’t just a rerun. It’s a wrecking ball—this time aimed at tourism, one of the last industries actually bringing money into America.

Let’s start with the number: two hundred fifty-three point nine billion. That’s what international tourists spent here in 2024. Nearly seven hundred million dollars a day. It’s our biggest service export—bigger than tech, finance, even Hollywood.

And we’re blowing it up on purpose.

Since January, horror stories have been piling up. Two German teenagers land in Hawaii. They’ve got valid travel documents, they’re fresh out of school, just looking to backpack and see the country. They get pulled aside, interrogated, strip-searched, forced into prison uniforms, and deported. Their crime? Saying they might freelance online. No clients. No job. Just the idea was enough to throw them on a plane to Japan.

A French researcher gets turned away after agents scan his email and find criticism of Trump. A Canadian with a legit job offer is held for twelve days with no charges. Hundreds of international students have had visas yanked for stuff like traffic tickets or joining a protest.

The message is loud and clear: if you’re not a citizen, you’re a suspect.

And tourists? They’re paying attention. International visits are dropping. Canadian arrivals to Florida down over thirty percent in just one quarter. Airline bookings from Canada this summer? Down over seventy percent. Europeans are pulling back too.

And no, it’s not the weather. It’s not inflation. It’s fear. Fear of being detained. Fear of losing a phone. Fear of a border agent going full Homeland Security cosplay on your vacation.

Here’s how deep the paranoia runs—tourists now trade tips on how to hide their political views before entering the U.S. Use burner phones. Delete social media. Never, ever criticize Trump within earshot of customs. Sound like fun? No? That’s why people are skipping Disney and booking trips to Paris instead.

This isn’t theoretical. It’s economic suicide.

Florida made nearly fifteen billion dollars off international tourists last year. Texas tourism is a hundred ninety billion dollar industry. Vegas just hit a record in gambling revenue—but that cash flow depends on foreigners still showing up.

Now they’re not.

Tourism economists are slashing forecasts. Sixty-four billion in projected losses this year. Goldman Sachs says it could go as high as ninety billion. That’s not a dip—that’s a collapse.

And it gets worse.

Trump’s war on visitors is now threatening the World Cup. Yeah, the one we’re co-hosting. FIFA officials are openly talking about backup plans if the U.S. becomes too unstable—Canada and Mexico are preparing to step in. The reason? Visa nightmares. Athlete detentions. Security risks. Sponsors don’t want their logos next to authoritarian chaos.

Same with the Olympics in L.A. The International Olympic Committee has already flagged red alerts over border policies, trans athlete bans, and unpredictable entry enforcement. Multiple countries—including close allies—are warning travelers and weighing whether they’ll even show up.

This could be the biggest diplomatic sports disaster since the Cold War boycotts.

We were supposed to host the biggest events in the world. Instead, we’re getting sidelined by our own politics.

Look at the data. Travel advisories from countries like Canada, the UK, Germany, and Australia now warn their citizens about visiting the U.S. Retaliatory boycotts are on the table. Sponsors are getting cold feet.

You want to know how to lose hundreds of billions in tourism, soft power, and international goodwill?

Easy. Just keep treating tourists like terrorists. Keep letting border agents search phones for political views. Keep jailing kids for saying they might code a website.

The American Dream doesn’t sell when it looks like a customs checkpoint.

This isn’t just bad PR. It’s a collapse in credibility. And red states—the same ones that cheered for this—are about to feel it in the tax receipts.

Florida, Texas, Nevada—y’all voted to own the libs. Congrats. You just deported your own damn economy.

You can’t strip-search your way to prosperity.

You can’t cancel conferences and call it freedom.

And you sure as hell can’t throw athletes, scientists, and tourists into detention and expect the world to keep showing up.

So here we are.

Hosting the World Cup. Hosting the Olympics.

And maybe—just maybe—getting kicked out of both.

Because America isn’t a destination anymore.

It’s a warning.
