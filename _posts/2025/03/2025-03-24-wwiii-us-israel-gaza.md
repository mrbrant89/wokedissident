## The Axis of Genocide

World War III won’t be sparked by Putin, Xi, or Kim Jong-un.

Not directly.

It’s already unraveling—and the U.S. and Israel are lighting the match.

We’re told to fear Russia and China while our closest ally is bombing refugee camps, starving civilians, and flattening entire city blocks. And we’re paying for it. Over $14 billion in U.S. military aid has poured into Israel in the last six months while Americans can’t afford insulin or rent.

We’re not the good guys. We’re the ones lighting the match.

## The Gaza Genocide

Since October 7, Israel has killed over 41,000 Palestinians, displaced over 90% of Gaza’s population, and obliterated what’s left of its hospitals, schools, and shelters [1](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/10/the-human-toll-of-israels-war-on-gaza), [2](https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/02/28/hopeless-starving-and-besieged).

That’s tens of thousands of children, journalists, doctors, and civilians incinerated in their homes, schools, and hospitals.

The Israeli military is bombing so-called “safe zones,” blocking humanitarian aid, and openly discussing permanent occupation of Gaza [3](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/analyzing-israels-strategy-in-gaza/), [4](https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/east-mediterranean/israelpalestine/stopping-israels-war-gaza).

International law experts, including Amnesty International and UN Special Rapporteurs, are calling it what it is: genocide [5](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/03/israel-committing-genocide-in-gaza/), [6](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/03/un-human-rights-experts-condemn-violence-gaza).

But instead of calling for a ceasefire, the U.S. vetoed every single UN resolution demanding one. Biden even tried to send more weapons to Israel during a famine.

You don’t flatten refugee camps with U.S.-made bombs and call it democracy.

## The Trump-Palestine Riviera

And to top it off? The video promoting this fever dream includes a surreal, AI-generated simulation of what Gaza could become—if we just erase all the people. Palm trees, glowing beaches, towers of glass and gold. And playing in the background? A ridiculous jingle custom-made for Trump, as if Disney were hired to market colonialism.

The lyrics sound like something cooked up by ChatGPT on Ambien: 

> "Donald’s coming to set you free, bringing the life for all to see. No more tunnels, no more fear, Trump Gaza is finally here. Trump Gaza shining bright, golden future a brand new light. Feast and dance the deal is done, Trump Gaza number one."

{% include video id="PslOp883rfI" provider="youtube" %}

Let’s be clear: this video isn’t just tone-deaf—it’s evil.

While children are being pulled from rubble, Trump and his goons are fantasizing about luxury condos on top of mass graves. They didn’t just erase Palestinians from the map—they replaced them with beachfront property and a golden idol.

This isn’t a gaffe. It’s the blueprint.

The U.S. doesn’t want peace in Gaza. It wants possession.
That AI-generated fantasy is a digital land grab—a preview of the colonial dream. Bulldoze the resistance. Flatten the homes. Build the resorts. Then act shocked when people fight back.

It’s not reconstruction. It’s real estate conquest wrapped in genocide denial.

No one watching that video should walk away thinking, “this is absurd.”
They should walk away thinking, “this is exactly what they plan to do.”

## The War Comes Home

Meanwhile, anyone who dares speak out in the U.S. is targeted.

Students who chant “Free Palestine” are being surveilled, expelled, and now deported. Yes, deported [7](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/15/un-condemns-deportation-of-pro-palestinian-students).

One Indian PhD student at Princeton was almost thrown out of the country by the Trump administration for criticizing U.S. foreign policy [8](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/03/judge-bars-trump-from-deporting-princeton-academic). Sound familiar?

Now, far-right groups like Accuracy in Media are literally creating blacklists of students to “deport, expel, and blacklist from jobs” [9](https://theintercept.com/2025/02/28/palestine-student-blacklist-accuracy-in-media/).

They’re calling it “national security.”

It’s not. It’s McCarthyism with a Zionist twist.

Blacklists. Deportations. Surveillance. You don’t need fascists in uniforms when you’ve got donor-funded watchdogs doing the same job.

And if you think this is about Hamas, you’re missing the point. The real threat to America isn’t a rocket from Gaza. It’s the erosion of civil liberties under the banner of loyalty to a foreign government.

## The Hypocrisy Olympics

Imagine the U.S. supporting Russia as it bombs Ukrainian hospitals and blocks aid. Or backing China while it levels Taiwan.

That’s what we’re doing with Israel. And every time we wag our finger at Putin or Xi, they laugh—and rightly so.

Our outrage is color-coded. If it’s white Europeans, we send weapons. If it’s brown Muslims, we send excuses.

We’ve lost all moral authority.

The International Criminal Court wants to prosecute Putin for war crimes.
The same court is investigating Israel for genocide.
But guess who doesn’t recognize the ICC’s jurisdiction? You guessed it—the U.S. and Israel.

That’s not rule of law. That’s rule of convenience.

## The Future Is Already Here

You know what sparks world wars? Proxy conflicts, dehumanization, and impunity.

We’re fighting a Cold War 2.0 with China.
Funding a proxy war in Ukraine.
Arming Israel’s ethnic cleansing in Gaza.
Threatening Iran every other week.
And treating protesters at home like traitors.

This isn’t a slippery slope. It’s a vertical drop.

## Conclusion: No One Gets to Plead Ignorance

You don’t get to say, “I didn’t know.” Not anymore.

We’re watching genocide unfold in real time—with receipts, livestreams, and satellite photos. And we’re watching civil liberties dissolve alongside it.

The U.S. isn’t preventing WWIII. We’re driving the getaway car.

Stop calling it defense. Stop calling it democracy. And stop pretending we’re not complicit.

If we want to avoid global catastrophe, we need to start by cutting the funding, cutting the propaganda, and cutting the goddamn complicity.

Because this isn’t just about Palestine.

It’s about who we are—and who we become.
