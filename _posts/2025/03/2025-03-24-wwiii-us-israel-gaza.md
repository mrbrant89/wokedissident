## The Axis of Genocide

World War III won’t be sparked by Putin, Xi, or Kim Jong-un. Not directly.

It’s already unraveling—and the U.S. and Israel are lighting the match.

We’re told to fear Russia and China while our closest ally is bombing refugee camps, starving civilians, and flattening entire city blocks. And we’re paying for it. Over $14 billion in U.S. military aid has poured into Israel in the last six months while Americans can’t afford insulin or rent.

Let’s stop pretending we’re the good guys.

## The Gaza Genocide

Since October 7, Israel has killed over **41,000 Palestinians**, displaced over **90%** of Gaza’s population, and obliterated what’s left of its hospitals, schools, and shelters [1](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/15/the-human-toll-of-israels-war-on-gaza-by-the-numbers), [2](https://www.hrw.org/report/2024/11/14/hopeless-starving-and-besieged/israels-forced-displacement-palestinians-gaza).

The Israeli military is bombing so-called “safe zones,” blocking humanitarian aid, and openly discussing permanent occupation of Gaza [3](https://www.brookings.edu/events/analyzing-israels-strategy-in-gaza), [4](https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/east-mediterranean-mena/israelpalestine/stopping-israels-war-gaza).

International law experts, including **Amnesty International** and **UN Special Rapporteurs**, are calling it what it is: **genocide** [5](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/12/amnesty-international-concludes-israel-is-committing-genocide-against-palestinians-in-gaza), [6](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/10/7-october-un-experts-call-end-violence-and-accountability-after-year-human).

But instead of calling for a ceasefire, the U.S. vetoed every single UN resolution demanding one. Biden even tried to send **more weapons** to Israel during a famine.

The irony? Israel claims it’s “defending democracy.”

You don’t bomb democracy into existence.

## The War Comes Home

Meanwhile, anyone who dares speak out in the U.S. is targeted.

Students who chant “Free Palestine” are being **surveilled**, **expelled**, and now **deported**. Yes, **deported** [7](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/12/deporting-international-students-involved-pro-palestinian-protests-will).

One Indian PhD student at Princeton was almost thrown out of the country by the Trump administration **for criticizing U.S. foreign policy** [8](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/27/indian-academic-deportation-trump-administration-free-speech). Sound familiar?

Now, far-right groups like **Accuracy in Media** are literally creating **blacklists of students** to “deport, expel, and blacklist from jobs” [9](https://www.theintercept.com/2024/10/30/blacklist-students-palestine-protest-accuracy-in-media/).

They’re calling it “national security.”

It’s not. It’s McCarthyism with a Zionist twist.

And if you think this is about Hamas, you’re missing the point. The real threat to America isn’t a rocket from Gaza. It’s the **erosion of civil liberties** under the banner of loyalty to a foreign government.

## The Hypocrisy Olympics

Imagine the U.S. supporting **Russia** as it bombs Ukrainian hospitals and blocks aid. Or backing **China** while it levels Taiwan.

That’s what we’re doing with Israel. And every time we wag our finger at Putin or Xi, they laugh—and rightly so.

We’ve lost all moral authority.

- The International Criminal Court wants to prosecute **Putin** for war crimes.
- The same court is **investigating Israel** for genocide.
- But guess who doesn’t recognize the ICC’s jurisdiction? You guessed it—**the U.S. and Israel**.

That’s not rule of law. That’s rule of convenience.

## The Future Is Already Here

You know what sparks world wars? Proxy conflicts, dehumanization, and impunity.

- We’re fighting a Cold War 2.0 with **China**.
- Funding a proxy war in **Ukraine**.
- Arming Israel’s ethnic cleansing in **Gaza**.
- Threatening **Iran** every other week.
- And treating **protesters at home** like traitors.

This isn’t a slippery slope. It’s a vertical drop.

## Conclusion: No One Gets to Plead Ignorance

You don’t get to say, “I didn’t know.” Not anymore.

We’re watching genocide unfold in real time—with receipts, livestreams, and satellite photos. And we’re watching civil liberties dissolve alongside it.

The U.S. isn't preventing WWIII. We're **driving the getaway car**.

Stop calling it defense. Stop calling it democracy. And stop pretending we’re not complicit.

If we want to avoid global catastrophe, we need to start by **cutting off the bombs**, **cutting off the bullshit**, and **cutting off the silence**.

Because this isn’t just about Palestine.

It’s about who we are—and who we become.
