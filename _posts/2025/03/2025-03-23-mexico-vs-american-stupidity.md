## Tariffing Your Neighbors: The Dumbest Diplomacy

Let‚Äôs get one thing straight: the U.S., Mexico, and Canada aren't just neighbors. We‚Äôre economically conjoined twins (triplets?). You put a tariff on one, you're punching yourself in the face.

Trump doesn‚Äôt care.

He slapped a 25% tariff on most Mexican and Canadian imports in 2025. The reason? Fentanyl. Never mind that fentanyl seizures hit historic lows under Biden, or that *80%* of trafficking arrests were Americans, not Mexicans <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/trumps-25-tariffs-on-canada-and-mexico-will-be-a-blow-to-all-3-economies/">[1]</a>.

## Supply Chain Suicide

Here‚Äôs how stupid this gets:

Cars assembled in North America aren‚Äôt just made in one country. A single vehicle might cross the U.S.-Mexico border *eight times* before it‚Äôs finished. Tariffing Mexico is like taxing yourself for using your own printer.

U.S. manufacturers warned Trump. Economists screamed. But MAGA logic doesn't do nuance. It does headlines.

Mexico is the **U.S.‚Äôs #1 trading partner** as of 2024. More than $800 billion in goods flowed across our border last year. A tariff war here isn‚Äôt just bad policy‚Äîit‚Äôs economic suicide.

And it‚Äôs not just cars. Agricultural goods, medical devices, semiconductors, avocados, tequila‚Äîthis stuff powers jobs, feeds families, and fills shelves in both countries. You screw with that, you screw with *everyone*.

## Claudia Played It Smart

When Trump made threats, President Claudia Sheinbaum didn‚Äôt take the bait. She stayed calm, held the line, deployed troops at the border (again), and let Trump declare "victory."

The result? Trump respects her. Because he only understands power, not policy.

Sheinbaum‚Äôs leadership is calm, technocratic, and strategic‚Äîeverything the Trump clown show isn‚Äôt. She‚Äôs a physicist with a PhD in energy engineering. Trump barely reads his own tweets.

Contrast that with Canada, which reacted with justified outrage. Trudeau banned all U.S. liquor from government shelves. It was badass‚Äîand personal. And Trump took it that way.

## Mexico Is Doing What America Won‚Äôt

While the U.S. is busy taxing avocados and pretending fentanyl comes in taco shells, Mexico is actually building a future worth living in:

- **Expanded pensions** for seniors by 25% under Sheinbaum‚Äôs 2025 budget <a href="https://www.gob.mx/presidencia/articulos/presupuesto-2025-pensiones">[2]</a>.
- **Free public healthcare** extended to informal workers under IMSS-Bienestar <a href="https://imssbienestar.gob.mx/">[3]</a>.
- **Scholarships for high schoolers** to stay in school through "Becas Benito Ju√°rez" <a href="https://www.gob.mx/becasbenitojuarez">[4]</a>.
- **Universal school meals** launched nationwide <a href="https://www.gob.mx/alimentacion-escolar">[5]</a>.
- **Free vision checks and eyeglasses** in all public schools by 2024 <a href="https://www.gob.mx/salud/articulos/lentes-gratis-para-ninas-y-ninos-en-primaria">[6]</a>.
- **Increased R&D funding** for science and national innovation <a href="https://conacyt.mx">[7]</a>.
- **A Mexican-made EV**, the Zacua MX3, being redesigned to cost under $10,000 USD <a href="https://zacua.com">[8]</a>.

And there‚Äôs more coming: the **Interoceanic Corridor** (a mega infrastructure project linking the Pacific and Atlantic) is under construction. **Green hydrogen** pilot projects are underway. Mexico‚Äôs building an **innovation economy** while we‚Äôre stuck debating whether climate change is ‚Äúwoke.‚Äù

## Meanwhile in the U.S‚Ä¶

We can‚Äôt pass a budget without threatening a government shutdown. Our healthcare system is still a corporate hunger game. Public schools are starved, under attack, or both. And the average American family can‚Äôt afford an EV‚Äîbecause the ones made here start at $40K.

Mexico just announced a sub-$10K electric vehicle built *entirely in Mexico*. Think about that. Affordable. Electric. Domestic. Meanwhile, the U.S. is subsidizing billion-dollar car companies that raise prices anyway.

We are not a serious country.

## Mexico Rising, America Whining

### The Side-by-Side Breakdown

| üá≤üáΩ Mexico Under Sheinbaum | üá∫üá∏ America Under Trump 2.0 |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Universal school meals     | School lunch debt shaming |
| Free vision care for kids  | Banning books in libraries |
| Expanded pensions by 25%   | Threatening Social Security |
| National healthcare for all| Private insurers in charge |
| $10K electric car (domestic) | $40K EVs with federal subsidies |
| Investing in green hydrogen| Subsidizing fossil fuels   |
| Building a Pacific-Atlantic corridor | Letting bridges collapse |
| R&D funding surge          | War on science & DEI       |
| Stable governance under a physicist | Chaos under a failed casino mogul |

This isn‚Äôt just a flex‚Äîit‚Äôs a wake-up call.

### Claudia Sheinbaum Is the Real Deal

Mexico‚Äôs president isn‚Äôt just smart. She‚Äôs visionary. A climate scientist. An energy engineer. A policy nerd with backbone. And she‚Äôs delivering‚Äîon equity, sustainability, education, and dignity.

Sheinbaum isn‚Äôt posturing for cable news soundbites. She‚Äôs governing. She‚Äôs doing the hard, boring, necessary work that American politicians have forgotten how to do‚Äîor just never cared to.

She‚Äôs not perfect. No leader is. But she‚Äôs proof that competent, science-based, socially-conscious leadership can still win. And lead. And build.

The contrast couldn‚Äôt be clearer.

While the U.S. melts down in culture wars, Mexico is getting shit done. Not by being perfect‚Äîbut by governing with a minimum level of competence and decency.

This isn‚Äôt some neoliberal fantasy. It‚Äôs what‚Äôs actually happening. And it‚Äôs making the U.S. look like the drunk uncle at the G20.

Mexico has problems. Corruption, cartels, inequality‚Äîbut they're at least *trying* to solve them.

Here? We elect people who blame immigrants for everything and solve nothing.

If the 20th century belonged to America, the 21st is up for grabs. And right now, Mexico‚Äôs playing to win while we‚Äôre too busy screaming about drag shows and banning books.

## Choose Your Future

We could have nice things. We could work with Mexico, not against it. We could build electric cars, feed kids, and give seniors dignity.

We could partner with a rising Mexico to build a 21st-century economic bloc‚Äîclean energy, smart infrastructure, equitable development.

Instead, we‚Äôre stuck in the 1950s with Cold War logic, white nationalist dog whistles, and a gerontocracy afraid of solar panels.

Mexico isn‚Äôt just succeeding *despite* the U.S. anymore‚Äîit‚Äôs succeeding *without* it.

This isn‚Äôt about nationalism. It‚Äôs about vision. And right now, the most competent, forward-thinking governance on the continent is coming out of Mexico City‚Äînot Washington, D.C.

Meanwhile, the U.S. is stuck in an endless loop of performative dysfunction: tariffs for show, wars of culture, and budgets designed to fail.

We have a choice. Cooperation or collapse. Growth or grift. Partnership or paranoia.

Mexico‚Äôs choosing progress.

We‚Äôre choosing punchlines.

So yeah‚Äîkeep tariffing your biggest trading partner and watch the future drive right past you in a Mexican-built electric car.

Hope you like the view from the rearview mirror, America.
