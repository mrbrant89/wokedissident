## History Repeats Itself—If You Let It

America is sleepwalking into authoritarianism. The warning signs are there, screaming in our faces, yet millions refuse to see them. Trump and his movement are not just “conservatives” with strong opinions—they are laying the groundwork for a full-blown fascist takeover, with **Project 2025 as the blueprint.**

If this sounds dramatic, that’s because it is. The same excuses people make today—*it can’t happen here, the courts will stop him, our institutions are strong*—were made in 1930s Europe. They were wrong then, and they are wrong now.

If we don’t stop this now, we may not get another chance.

## The 1930s Playbook—Now in the U.S.

The rise of fascism in 1930s Europe followed a pattern: an economic crisis, widespread disillusionment with democracy, a strongman promising national “greatness,” the vilification of outsiders, the slow erosion of civil liberties, and a systematic dismantling of institutions. Sound familiar?

Let’s break it down:

### 1. **The Strongman Cult**

Hitler, Mussolini, and Franco all positioned themselves as *the only solution* to their nation’s decline. Trump has done the same, turning himself into a godlike figure for MAGA cultists, claiming **only he can fix America.**

> “I alone can fix it.” — Donald Trump, 2016 RNC Speech

Trump doesn’t just have supporters; he has devotees. They don’t care about policies, laws, or even democracy itself—only that their leader stays in power. This is exactly how authoritarian movements consolidate control.

### 2. **Demonizing the “Enemy”**

Fascists need scapegoats. Jews, communists, immigrants, LGBTQ people—someone must always be blamed for the country’s problems.

Trump and MAGA have embraced this tactic fully:
- Immigrants are “poisoning the blood of the nation” ([AP News](https://apnews.com/article/trump-rally-immigration-poisoning-blood-22d3127481b5c35aee0f8eb2b061a2dd)).
- LGBTQ rights are a “threat to children” ([Human Rights Campaign](https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/trump-administration-continues-attacks-on-lgbtq-rights)).
- The media is “the enemy of the people” ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2018/08/16/639395332/trump-calls-the-media-the-enemy-of-the-people-heres-a-history-of-the-phrase)).
- Democrats are “vermin” who need to be “rooted out” ([PBS](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-defends-calling-political-opponents-vermin)).

This isn’t just rhetoric. Project 2025 is designed to **criminalize** being LGBTQ, to **purge** civil servants who aren’t loyal to Trump, and to **weaponize** the government against his political enemies.

### 3. **The End of Democracy—Through Democracy**

Hitler was elected. Mussolini was invited into government. They didn’t start by abolishing democracy outright—they **used democracy to destroy it.**

Trump and his allies are following the same strategy:
- **Destroy trust in elections** so their base only believes results when they win.
- **Pack the courts** with loyalists who will rubber-stamp their agenda.
- **Suppress the vote** through aggressive voter purges and gerrymandering.
- **Criminalize dissent**, just as Florida has done by arresting peaceful protesters ([AP News](https://apnews.com/article/florida-protests-desantis-arrests-bill-rights-4b83f58bc08980d9b6014c79e8f9720e)).

### 4. **The Takeover of Institutions**

Project 2025 explicitly states its goal: **to purge the federal government of anyone who is not MAGA.** That means:
- **Replacing the DOJ, FBI, and military leadership** with loyalists.
- **Gutting independent agencies** like the EPA and FTC.
- **Eliminating the Department of Education** to push Christian nationalism in schools.
- **Defunding public media** and controlling the narrative.

This is a direct parallel to how Hitler consolidated power after 1933, turning government institutions into Nazi-controlled arms of the state. Once they control the executive branch, **there is nothing stopping them from weaponizing it against their enemies.**

## The War on Protest: Redefining Civil Liberties

MAGA has been waging an assault on the right to protest, using the term “illegal protest” to delegitimize peaceful demonstrations. There is no such thing as an “illegal protest” in America—the First Amendment explicitly protects the right to assemble and speak out against the government.

Yet, conservatives have worked tirelessly to reframe protests as unlawful acts, particularly in response to movements they dislike. The protests at Columbia University in 2024 were a prime example: a peaceful demonstration was labeled as an “illegal occupation” by MAGA pundits, despite clear constitutional protections ([AP News](https://apnews.com/article/columbia-protests-illegal-free-speech-23d4f8f72b35)). This is the same tactic authoritarians have always used—repeat a lie enough times, and people will believe it. If they successfully redefine protest as criminal activity, Americans will surrender their civil liberties without even realizing it.

## Why Trump? Why Him?

Of all the possible cult leaders, why Trump? He’s not smart. He’s not good at business—he bankrupted a **casino.** He’s not attractive. He smells bad. He reportedly soils himself regularly. Yet millions worship him.

Why? Because MAGA isn’t about competency—it’s about rage. Trump gives his followers permission to hate, to be cruel, to blame others for their problems. It’s fascism at its core: a movement driven not by policy, but by grievance.

## America’s Fragile Institutions—And Why They Won’t Save Us

One of the biggest myths keeping people complacent is the idea that *“our institutions will stop him.”* This is dangerously naive.

The U.S. Constitution was not designed to handle a fully corrupt executive branch. The courts can rule against Trump, but **who enforces the rulings?** If the DOJ is under MAGA control, they won’t prosecute. If the Supreme Court says Trump can’t do something, he can simply ignore them. Who’s going to stop him? The police? The military? **Not if he replaces their leadership first.**

The Founding Fathers never imagined a scenario where a sitting president simply ignores the law, and no one has the power to make him obey it. **But that’s exactly what will happen.**

## The Wake-Up Call—Before It’s Too Late

If you think this sounds extreme, remember: **every failed democracy thought the same.**

This is our moment. **We either stop this now, or we lose America forever.**

**Time is running out.**

## What Can We Do? Fighting Back Before It’s Too Late

This is not a time for apathy. The levers of power may be failing us, but **we are not powerless.** Here’s what you can do:

### **1. Mass Protests—And Relentless Civil Disobedience**
Authoritarian regimes only succeed when the people let them. History shows that **sustained, large-scale protests disrupt fascist takeovers.**
- Take to the streets. Peaceful protests must be **massive, constant, and unavoidable.**
- If they call protests "illegal," do it anyway—**the First Amendment is on our side.**
- **Students, workers, activists**—this is your moment. If we shut down the economy and refuse to comply, they will lose control.

### **2. Economic Boycotts—Hit Their Donors Where It Hurts**
- MAGA billionaires and corporations **fund this movement.** Cut off their cash flow.
- **Boycott companies** that bankroll Trump and Project 2025.
- **Move your money** out of banks funding right-wing extremism.
- **Support unions, small businesses, and organizations** that fight back.

### **3. Flood Your Elected Officials With Calls and Pressure**
- Call **your representatives, senators, governors, and mayors**—**every single day.**
- Demand they block Trump’s agenda. **They work for us, not him.**
- Show up at town halls (for the ones that have the cajones to actually hold them), **make them uncomfortable.** They need to fear the people more than they fear Trump.

### **4. Organize, Vote, and Defend Elections**
- **The 2026 and 2028 elections are not regular elections.** They will be a fight for democracy itself.
- **Register voters. Get people to the polls.**
- Volunteer for election protection efforts—**MAGA wants to suppress votes. We won’t let them.**

### **5. Do Not Submit to Fear**
- They want you to feel powerless. **You are not.**
- They want you to stop protesting. **Don’t.**
- They want you to think resistance is useless. **It isn’t.**

The time to act is **now.** Future generations will ask what we did when democracy was under attack.

What will your answer be?
