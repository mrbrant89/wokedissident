## They Don’t Love America. They Love Trump.

Imagine Barack Obama handing Elon Musk access to top-secret Pentagon war plans. Fox News would be hosting an all-day stroke. Hannity would be live from a bunker, Tucker would reappear from exile, and every MAGA uncle at every Cracker Barrel in the country would be calling for impeachment.

But when Trump’s orbit does it?

Dead silence.

Because MAGA doesn’t care about national security. They don’t care about foreign policy. They don’t even care about the country. The only thing that matters is **unquestioning loyalty to Donald J. Trump**.

## National Security Is Optional—If You’re White and Worship Trump

Let’s start with Pete Hegseth. Former Army guy turned Fox News bro-tator. Once threw an axe on live TV and hit a bystander—not metaphorically, literally. And somehow, this guy is still weighing in on Pentagon policy like he’s a four-star general.

Then there’s Tulsi Gabbard. One failed presidential campaign, zero relevant qualifications, and a sudden hard-right turn that got her a permanent seat at the MAGA table. Why? Because she said “woke” in a sentence and scowled at Democrats on live TV.

And of course, **Kash Patel**, the low-rent Roy Cohn who’s been sniffing around classified documents like a bloodhound in a meth lab. No strategic chops, just a camera-ready temper and a loyalty fetish for Trump [1](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/13/kash-patel-classified-documents-trump-00051652).

But the crown jewel? Elon Musk.

This month, Musk met with Pentagon officials to discuss contingency plans for a war with China [2](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/21/us/politics/elon-musk-pentagon-meeting.html). Yes, the man who couldn’t manage Twitter without turning it into a neo-Nazi MySpace is now reviewing national war plans.

And where’s MAGA? Cheering. Because Elon’s cool with Trump now. Never mind his zero military experience, erratic behavior, and frequent public meltdowns. Trump likes him—so it’s all good.

But when **Lloyd Austin**, the actual **Secretary of Defense**, had a brief medical procedure and didn’t immediately issue a press release, the MAGA mob declared it a conspiracy [3](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/pentagon-kept-defense-secretary-lloyd-austins-hospitalization-secret-rcna131676).  

Fox News ran wall-to-wall coverage. Rumors of a “shadow government” and “dereliction of duty” spread like herpes at a Proud Boys rally.  

Why the difference? Simple. Austin is Black. Musk is white. Austin is a Biden appointee. Musk is Trump-adjacent. That’s all it takes.

## It Started With Birtherism—and Never Stopped

Let’s stop pretending this is about ideology.

Trump didn’t win hearts and minds with policy. He launched his political career by accusing the first Black president of being an African sleeper cell [4](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/donald-trump-obama-birther-228304). Birtherism wasn’t a sideshow—it was the main act. It told white America exactly what they wanted to hear:

> *“You don’t have to respect this Black guy. He’s not really one of us.”*

Everyone lost their shit over it—and rightly so. The idea that a sitting president was illegitimate because he had a Kenyan father was racist, absurd, and wildly un-American.

**Fast forward to now**, and we’ve got an actual African oligarch—**Elon Musk**, born in **apartheid South Africa**—essentially **shaping U.S. military policy**, influencing elections, controlling the flow of public information, and sitting in on Pentagon meetings [2](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/21/us/politics/elon-musk-pentagon-meeting.html).  

And guess what?

Because he’s white, rich, and cosplays as Tony Stark, **MAGA doesn’t just tolerate it—they worship him**.

Let’s break this down:

- **Musk was raised in apartheid South Africa**, during a regime that legalized white supremacy. His family reportedly benefited from the system, with access to wealth and privilege that most Black South Africans were violently denied [14](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/elon-musk-emerald-mine/).  
- He now controls **SpaceX**, which holds billions in U.S. military contracts—**including launching national security satellites** [15](https://spacenews.com/spacex-wins-1-4-billion-u-s-space-force-launch-contracts/).
- He owns **Starlink**, a private satellite network used by the U.S. and Ukrainian militaries—and last year, **he unilaterally cut access to Ukraine during an active operation**, reportedly to avoid provoking Russia [16](https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/08/politics/elon-musk-ukraine-russia-drone/index.html).
- He’s turned Twitter—sorry, “X”—into a megaphone for conspiracy theorists, white nationalists, and antisemitic trolls, all under the banner of “free speech” [17](https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-report-documents-proliferation-hate-twitter-following-musk-takeover).

And yet, he still gets Pentagon invites, defense briefings, and full deference from the same crowd that screamed bloody murder over Obama’s tan suit.

Where’s the outrage now? Where’s the “America First” crowd?

Nowhere. Because **Elon is one of “them”**—rich, white, and ideologically useful.

The irony is suffocating. MAGA threw a nationwide tantrum over the *idea* that Obama might be “foreign,” but now they’re handing the keys to national defense to a guy whose **entire worldview was shaped under a white supremacist regime**—and not one of them gives a damn.

## Ukraine? Hell No. But Israel? Blank Check.

MAGA loves to scream about the billions sent to Ukraine.

> *“We should be fixing OUR country!”*

They’ll post memes with potholes in Detroit next to tanks in Kyiv and rant about “wasting taxpayer dollars.”

But ask them about **Israel**, the single largest recipient of U.S. foreign aid for over **60 years** [8](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/how-much-aid-does-us-give-israel). No complaints. Not a peep.

Why? Because **Trump told them Israel is “special.”** That’s it. That’s the entire geopolitical analysis.

They’re not anti-war. They’re not anti-aid. They’re anti-anything Trump didn’t explicitly endorse.

Even when Ukraine is literally fighting off a fascist invasion from a war criminal who poisons his enemies and assassinates journalists [9](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/how-russia-has-silenced-its-critics-under-putin-2024-02-16/), MAGA sides with the invader—because Trump said Putin was a “genius” [10](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-calls-putin-genius-says-russia-invasion-ukraine-smart-rcna17417).

Aid to Ukraine isn’t the issue. **Loyalty is.**

## Patriotism Is Just a Costume

These people call themselves patriots. They drape themselves in flags, scream “1776,” and cosplay as colonial rebels.

But their actions tell a different story.

- They cheered when Trump **called for terminating the Constitution** [11](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/03/us/politics/trump-constitution-truth-social.html).
- They shrugged when he **stole classified documents** and stored them in his golf resort bathrooms [12](https://www.justice.gov/storage/US_v_Trump-Nauta_23-80101.pdf).
- They defended a literal **attempted coup** on January 6 [13](https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/capitol-breach-cases).

If Biden let a tech bro play general, they’d riot. If Obama misled the public about a surgery, they’d scream 25th Amendment.

But with Trump? The rules don’t apply. There are no standards. Just vibes, racism, and bootlicking.

## This Isn’t a Movement. It’s a Cult.

This isn’t about policy. It’s not about spending. It’s sure as hell not about America.

It’s about Trump.

Trump is the sun MAGA orbits. Everything else—national security, foreign aid, military readiness—is just debris. If you’re loyal to him, you can be a flaming dumpster of a human being and still run the country. If you’re not, you’re the enemy.

That’s not patriotism.

That’s fascism in a red hat.
